        <h1>A Critical Reappraisal of the Sociohistorical Underpinnings of not being able to eat gluten anymore</h1>
        <h5>VI·XIX·MMXXV - VIII·XIII·MMXXV</h5>
        Fast-forward through the summer yeah? Never as fun as a single adult. Hope y'all got some nice sun. Good lord.
        Where to start? Many thoughts have been rattling around for many days. I should get better at updating this regularly. If anything for my own practice in
        journaling. I guess I'll start with a useless plea into the void. For the love of christ do NOT scan your government
        id or face into any of these apps or websites. I already made the lame joke on my profile; but I can't believe just
        because thiel wants to play irl mr house we have to expose ourselves to insane privacy concerns just to jack off.
        Hyperbole of course for now. Unless [redacted] soon I can't image <i>not</i> having to deal with that. Double negatives
        get gross. Hopefully I'm just a conspiracy nut job spouting nonsense on his site. My fear as of now is that
        that fucking moron is going to actually carry through, make d.c. a "freedom city", hand it over to thiel...
        What happens next? I mean that's ignoring so much shit that's currently happening. RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES! I
        can't believe there's not <b>ONE</b> true patriot working in the government now. Maybe there are none considering
        [redacted]. I guess I'm just here rambling to... no one? Future me? I don't read any of my writings once they get
        uploaded. Maybe I should? Maybe I will? I'm feeling a heavy blanket of constant anxiety with the state of the
        world I guess. I thought things would be easy. Or maybe just not this hard. Again, hate to be all "erhm we're
        literally living in idiocracy rn" but the white house rose garden got paved over and there are talks of hosting
        a goddamn wwe match there? Like what the hell? Military's 250th anniversary march <i>sponsored by the fucking
        ufc</i>? Maaan. Like that's objectively crazy right? I guess I really don't understand the right wing push the
        world seems to be making. Are rich people <i>that</i> goddamn rich? Like a <i>synchronized, global</i> effort?
        Hopefully I'm just a crazy nut job and everything's just kind of stupid right now. I guess I don't see the appeal
        otherwise, to right wing politics. Without of course a firehose of disinformation being shoved down your throat.
        I can see how single issue voters "have" to pick a side. That still seems flimsy as shit. My thought loops always
        come to a very unsatisfying "rich people are fucking insane". God. As an individual I've been working more on animation.
        Churned out a bunch of neat little art projects since the last update. I need to get all my code and scripts organized
        and in a presentable state. I've been spreading my videos and pictures a bit more. Marketing is never fun. I can't
        even pretend I'm doing that, just posting in more places. We'll see if I can continue posting on youtube here soon.
        Oh ya. A lot of my health problems recently may just be celiac disease. Yay on figuring that out. Boo on figuring
        that out. Ignorance is bliss. I mean I was still "suffering" but at least I was eating pasta and cake. So far I've
        struggled for good replacement recipes for everything. I'm anti-"replace everything with a gluten-free version".
        Like gf pasta blows. I'd rather have a meal inherently be gf. Does that make any sense? That's a weird thing I judge
        the veg people for. Like stop trying to make a burger replica, just eat good veg food. There's plenty of it.
        I wonder how many of these unhinged thoughts my mother has had. I wonder if my mother has had any of the same
        unhinged thoughts as me. That sounds a bit better. I'm bumping some music, dinner was good, maybe things are
        going to end up alright. Is it selfish to append a "for me" to that? I'm going to go ahead and just wrap this up.
        I'm sure the nsa is already in my pc scanning each and every bit. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>Inquiries into the Epistemological Ramifications of $5 off zyns</h1>
    <h5>V·XXII·MMXXV - VI·XVIII·MMXXV</h5>
    Ayo! It's been a bit I suppose. Toys acquired! New (to me) PC has arrived and is set up. My old paper printer
    died RIGHT when I got a new sketchbook. I had a bit of a spill with some ink and wanted to cover up some splotches.
    Mosey on over to the printer, "no print head detected". Disgusting. What do you MEAN? I love how it's been able to
    connect to the botnet and update itself LOUDLY at 3am. When it comes to getting use? No way. I couldn't even
    bypass the alert thing to access the scanner. DISGUSTING. I tried to pry it apart and put it back together with
    no luck. It would've been smart to try and figure out a use for it, but I'm already a bit of a hoarder. Anyways,
    it's been replaced. Have a nice toner printer now. Praying that solves the ink drinking problem. My first prints
    have already been clean and DRY. Not just absolutely sopping wet. I worked too slow on my buddy's site. His
    old one is down. Now I have to pry the info from him instead of copying text. Good problems to have in the grand
    scheme of things I guess. This is meant to be more diary-y, but I still want to avoid <i>certain</i> topics.
    I mean, things are pretty crazy to say the absolute least. Trying to carve out more of an escape I guess here.
    Even if it is stream of consciousness-y. I guess it can't be <i>that</i> stream of consciousness-y if I put
    everything through a filter beforehand. Brains man, so weird. Project wise, things have been quiet honestly.
    I did a little mixed media collage thing to break in the sketchbook and printer, have a couple of ideas baking
    but have yet to really dive in. No excuses there really. I re-re-restarted ghosts of tsushima recently. That's
    definitely been a time sink. Just lame adult personal "projects" really. Need to get into the COOL stuff.
    I can really feel its impacts on my mental health. I've been brainrotting with so much youtube and tiktok recently.
    Good lord. It can't be healthy to have access to that much content. I do just watch a lot of dumb stuff but I
    wonder how much it's all <i>really</i> formulated. I already know it's addicting but... Also, at a certain point
    you just sound conspiratorial. Or like a health nut. Ya know? Maybe? The rain has been nutty. The other day
    the dog and I got pelted by hail. He's been in plenty of snow and rain, but I guess not hail. Not that size at least.
    I think he liked it. Ice cubes are one of his favorite treats. Can you imagine like cupcakes falling out of the sky?
    Maybe some warm apple turnovers. Damn. I don't have cloudy with a chance of meatballs lore handy so the
    logistics of trying to catch a warm falling apple turnover without it hitting the ground is kind of funny.
    Is that what the movies are? I never liked the concept of the giant omelette from neopets. You'd always be
    getting a piece off the ground. This was definitely dumber than most, but I wanted to make up for the delay
    I guess. Must stay consistent in shouting into the void. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>An Exhaustive Treatise Upon the Origins, Development, and Present Condition of a vegetable soup with meat</h1>
    <h5>V·XXII·MMXXV - V·XXI·MMXXV</h5>
    My demon dog poked holes in my new yoga mat without hesitation. Adds character? I wrote a nice script
    that helps me write these blog updates. <a href=https://files.catbox.moe/qnuz5x.mp4>Check out a quick demo</a>.
    The weather has been beautiful. Windows have been open and the dog and I have been getting our steps in.
    Allergies still absolutely destroying me. Typing these in nvim is a bit weird. It keeps suggesting commands
    and words I've previously typed. Kinda just typing and rambling to fill this entry out. Mostly workflow testing.
    I got a new blanket that's nice and cozy. Actually the exact same pattern as my last one. Why are waffle irons so
    hard to clean. Those lil peg things are insane. I'm writing in nvim and I'm using 25% of my RAM? Seems a bit height.
    I might bake some cookies tonight. Nice treat after a lame work day. A little couch tray would be nice. Balance some drinks.
    I need to work on a new new animation. I should start learning to model for real. Never was my main goal. I don't know maaaaan.
    Sandwiches have been slappin recently. Damn I should've made some pickled peppers. This is mostly just a test I think I'll just cut
    it here. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>towards a theory on custom computer stuff in the modern world</h1>
    <h5>V·VIII·MMXXV - V·XVII·MMXXV</h5>
    It is done. Finally got around to a full linux rice. Really just expanding the design language of the website to hardware.
    I think it's neat. This is my first "real" edit in neovim too. Liking it so far. We'll see how smooth a git push goes.
    I guess I still need to do an edit on neofetch but that's not a very high priority. I got a custom power menu, the app
    menu looks good, I got my lockscreen dope, what else? I got a neat <nobr>date/time</nobr> entry on polybar.
    The whole shebang. Allergies are KILLING me. Anyways, I have it up and running as a daily runner. NEAT. I'm sure that I'm missing
    some more tools but time will tell. <strike>I'm unsure about the audio quality</strike> SIKE! Figured that out pretty easily.
    Just some driver stuff and a slight edit to an EQ app. It'll probably be a bit of that off and on for a while. It's getting late
    and I should get up early to hit the grocery store. I'll keep this one short a sweet. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>on the topic of ordering a $30 sandwich</h1>
    <h5>IV·XXX·MMXXV - V·VII·MMXXV</h5>
    <nobr>F O U R</nobr> new dumb animations just went live. They've existed online for a while at this point.
    It's real now that it's all linked and posted on <i>my</i> site though. I think it would be cool to have a microblog
    section. I <i>really</i> like how <a href="http://princss.online/microblog">princss.online</a> has theirs setup.
    Huge fan of the ratios and stacking. Cannot overstate how much I love all the dithering too. Such a cool lil
    aesthetic choice. Noticing it get "kinda big". Hard to really tell though with how insane the tiktok algorithm gets.
    Oh ya, I say it's getting big because every other video I see is some dithering technique. Nerds stay ahead of the curve B).
    That weekend I was dreading last post came and went without a hitch. Lmfao. Who could've guessed a fairly average
    day would go alright. A bit of weirdness afoot this week. Not entirely sure how to feel about it all. I think
    overthinking could just cause more of a headache. I still need to clean my printer. No idea why nothing's sticking.
    Beyond annoying having to nuke so many prints. I keep procrastinating. I took most of this week off. Beyond necessary
    for my mental health. Crazy how staying sane is now so much of my time (not being dramatic at all). One of my friends
    is getting into linux ricing which is just absolutely amazing. Was starting to doubt anyone irl even thought about
    that shit. Can't wait to see what gets whipped up. No idea what the next animation will be. Maybe a digital collage thing?
    I have a bunch of themed images lined up. Blender? Hardly knew her! The "spaces" have been fun to build and play with.
    I need to get blosm up and running again. I think I got rid of my token. Maybe the elevations were off? Still not
    100% on what's up there. I'd love a nap right now sheesh. 2pm hits like a train. Let's get a little workout in
    and see how things feel from there. Don't even ask me about my reading progress please. A library archive might be fun?
    Seems a shame to just swap out the 3d model spinning everytime. Yo, ok. Imagine maybe a digital bookshelf, and on click
    the model pops up with a review? That could look cool. Am I smart enough to give a review? I guess I'll keep it
    away from critiquing. JUST a "did I like it" type review. Just spitballing. A lot of questions here and in other places.
    What does it mean? Thanks for your time.

    <h5>IV·XXV·MMXXV - IV·XXIX·MMXXV</h5>
    First web gig. Nothing mindblowing, just being asked to make a personal site for someone. Paid this time. Very
    little of anything I think is badass and cool. It <i>is</i> for someone else and I still have no clout. Work is
    driving me insane. I wonder if I'll make it to retirement before going absolute postal (giving 2 weeks) and
    storming out. Maybe there will be a whole personal site resurgence and I'll be able to pay the bills as a freelancer.
    Probably not. I'm re-re-re-re-rendering my last animation. Touchdesigner chromakeying isn't as nice as I want it
    to be. Maybe there's more fiddling to do. I couldn't find a sweet spot yet with my animation. It almost works TOO
    well. Amazing what has green in it when you're trying to key it out. It's raining. In blender I just manually made
    some screens for the tv. I wanted a real green screen effect but it looked too bad. No more youtube views. Or
    music streams. Not surprising. A bit curious where the little pockets of streams come from though. There had to
    have been a popular song in europe that I was stealing shazzams from a few years ago. Words like 'few' and 'view'
    keep coming out as 'fewe' and 'viewe'. Ye olde neocities brain dump. I wonder if I'd be satisfied jacked into the
    mainframe. Just one of those brains in a jar plugged into a computer. Brooooooooo what if we're in the matrix
    right. now. maaaaaan. I still haven't won the lottery. Is there a way to manifest stronger manifestation powers?
    Last night was the first dnd session with the boys. Honestly? Surprised with how smoothly things ran. Looking
    forward to the next session. There's that one jrpg that came out. I already have a good enough backlog. Even limited
    to console. Some games just feel like couch games ya know? My pc is baking these renders pretty consistently anyways.
    I am dreading this saturday. Christ. I have a long weekend set for myself though. Why are so many work meetings
    <b>so</b> useless. It's a throwback to the first day of high school. Like when they just throw the freshman in to find
    their classes. Except I'm a salty, tired, very lame adult. "Let's go around the room and share a quote that
    inspires us!" I <i>know</i> it's just... team building or whatever. "I don't want to play the game" says the
    board piece. I guess I'm supposed to just start my own company and be my own boss right? Thanks for your time.

    <h1>a couple tweaks here and there</h1>
    <h5>IV·XXII·MMXXV - IV·XXIV·MMXXV</h5>
    Couple neat things got done I suppose. Finally got around to throwing together a homegrown guestbook. Seems a bit insane
    to me that there are so few applications out there. I constantly overestimate the number of personal site nerds.
    Neat to get it up though! I didn't want to run anything too crazy, just have some control over the css nawmean?
    Anyways, last animation went up in flames. Re-rendering 1k frames is always a blast. Got to learn a bit about
    the botnet render setup I was running, should be smoother sailing next time. I'm being bombarded by afterhour updates.
    Mostly people still trying to hype $rxrx. Personally just seems like a <i>bit</i> of a meme. What do I know though?
    I'm down 0.82% as of time of writing. That jesus and john wayne book is draining me. So boring and repetitive so far.
    It did help slightly guide a conversation with a good friend last night. Not a waste. Bunny day is finally done.
    I missed buying turnips this week though. I think I still have a stash of half a million bells, plenty of wiggle room.
    Final thoughts? I'm a bit hungry. I should eat breakfast earlier in the day. Pushing that off to send an update into the
    void is a bit silly. This isn't even <nobr>devlog/update</nobr> stuff. Pure morning stream of consciousness lmfao. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>first, definitely a stream of consciousness</h1>
    <h5>IV·XX·MMXXV - IV·XXI·MMXXV</h5>
    Diary/devlog type page for y'all I guess? Just a way for me to keep thoughts a bit more seperated and focused.
    Want to leave room for pretentious rambling perhaps without making my full front-facing site too casual.
    Happy easter! I'm looking forward to bunny day being over. Everytime I'm in the mood for some nh that rabbit is
    <nobr>l u r k i n g.</nobr> I need to update my main site w a few more animations that finally finished. There's one more being rendered now.
    Probably best to wait a bit. I'm having a ton of fun learning blender and touchdesigner.
    Absolutely draining though to ask for every single view. At the end of the day, my "art" is far from polished OR unique, so I get it.
    I don't know maaan, it's less about the <nobr>views/recognition/path</nobr> to monetization. More that anyone who
    <i>might</i> fuck with it just isn't seeing it. Pray to the algorithms I suppose. I'm certainly not doing myself any favors with the
    atrocious seo that I have going on. What happened to doing it for the love of the game. I don't <i>want</i> to be a
    marketer. That type of thinking is pretty entitled though. Can't be asking for instant gratification with objectively uninteresting hobby work.
    /shrug gotta focus on the fun of it. The real ones get it. Looking forward to a nice week ahead. The sun's out in full force
    and my work calendar is clear enough. (I'm cutting it close w rambling here before a meeting) I figured out a smarter
    way to spit renders out so hopefully there's a site update soon. Thanks for your time.
