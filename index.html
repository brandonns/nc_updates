        Diary/devlog type page for y'all I guess? Just a way for me to keep thoughts a bit more seperated and focused.
        Want to leave room for pretentious rambling perhaps without making my full front-facing site too casual.
        Happy easter! I'm looking forward to bunny day being over. Everytime I'm in the mood for some NH that rabbit is <nobr>l u r k i n g</nobr>.
        I need to update my main site w a few more animations that finally finished. There's one more being rendered now.
        Probably best to wait a bit. I'm having a ton of fun learning blender and touchdesigner.
        Absolutely draining though to ask for every single view. At the end of the day, my "art" is far from polished OR unique, so I get it.
        I don't know maaan, it's less about the <nobr>views/recognition/path to monetization.</nobr> More that anyone who <i>might</i>
        fuck with it just isn't seeing it. Pray to the algorithms I suppose. I'm certainly not doing myself any favors with the
        atrocious SEO that I have going on. What happened to doing it for the love of the game. I don't <i>want</i> to be a
        marketer. That type of thinking is pretty entitled though. Can't be asking for instant gratification with objectively uninteresting hobby work.
        /shrug gotta focus on the fun of it. The real ones get it. Looking forward to a nice week ahead. The sun's out in full force
        and my work calendar is clear enough. (I'm cutting it close w rambling here before a meeting) I figured out a smarter
        way to spit renders out so hopefully there's a site update soon. Thanks for your time.
