        Howdy howdy. Quick one this morning. Why even go through all this at all? I don't know. I'm in an all hands meeting
        now. lol. It's crazy how we're all broke so everyone's plan is huge enterprise deals. Slack notification sound
        hits for 15 psychic damage. Oof. Midweek hump? Maybe I have adhd or something. add? Is add still a thing? I've
        only heard about adhd for a while. Is that obvious to you guys? Unfair judgement. This is just bored rambling.
        I think now that I'm out of school any sort of official diagnosis would be a "waste". Do I want to be medicated for
        the rest of my life? I don't think so. All my friends that have gotten scrips are like "I'm so much more productive
        at work and I have no trouble doing all my chores!" It sounds great for getting turned into a robot. I don't want
        to be more productive at work. Actually I constantly bitch about my consistency. Lack thereof I guess. But I don't
        know isn't that the fun part of life? I guess I'm privileged enough to not be struggling. Maybe a bit lonely but
        isn't that like "the thing" nowadays? Plus trust me there are worse fates than living alone. Good lord. Not that
        I'm holding unhealthy grudges. It's fair to admit points of life are objectively lower than others. I would hope so.
        "99 problems was a damn good summer song if you got more than like 3 then something's wrong." $3.5T industry?
        Now that's a claim. I swear ubi would be easier than this. I have one of <i>those</i> jobs. Some people are surprised
        about me "irl". I lean too hard into the guy online sometimes. To be fair a lot of my hobbies lean into that as well.
        So I guess that's just me.
        I should've thought about images. I didn't think I'd ever want to share them here. See I think instagram would be
        cool if it still existed in any real capacity. I could just put them here and new tab link I guess. Maybe just a
        real about page? Thoughts. And things and stuff of course. I've been reading that book for a while huh. I can easily
        tune out voices to write but not to read. How about for y'all? Obligatory vague question. I might remove some of
        those guestbook entries. I appreciate it! I do! But irl people are asking "what writings?" Could you imagine?
        Weird how that works. So now no emails because I'm lazy, no guestbook posts because I'm embarrassed, eventually I'm
        just going to password protect everything. Maybe just move the guestbook back here? Meh, the whole point of <i>that</i>
        site is to be portfolioable. And the guestbook is a bit janky but all homegrown! I guess the stats might be a good
        enough backend showcase. Probably not if it's always empty. Skull emoji. Maybe I should get medicated. Maybe I
        should stay unmedicated. Heh. Cuz like. I make myself sick. Calm down not that way. I'm dealing with another
        gluten attack. I can't help it guys! ALL the good shit has gluten. I think it was some korean fried chicken this time?
        I actually got chickfila and popeyes too all in the same week. Don't think it. Don't say it! I'm kidding sometimes
        the jokes write themselves. Still problematic so don't go saying that shit. There's gluten in soy sauce. Wait so
        <b><i>NO</i></b> foods make your throat itchy? Man, the new css really shortens all these entries. Sometimes I get
        on such a roll here. Am I forcing it? For who? Y'all of course! I'm such a hypocrite. I say that a lot. "Why don't
        you try to be better then?" Probably for the same reason(s). Path of least resistance plus who would I be serving
        better. Plus I genuinely believe no one should be listening to me. Bro I'm just like some dude man. Is that even
        valid lmfao can I just say "don't listen to me alright here's words". I'm happy to yap obviously. But I also get
        uncomfortable with being an/the authority on anything. Again not in some self conscious way. I don't think so anyways.
        But more like you're looking for advice, knowledge, uhhh whatever <i>here</i> from <i>me</i>? You must have more
        than 3 problems. I can't wait for pto. Maybe I'm just bad at regulating my emotions. Maybe not? Even a shitty
        therapist would pick up on that right? Just breathe bro. How often do you change your <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>? +15 psychic damage. Oof. It's been silent I just
        remembered something. Maaan what a bummer. The world keeps spinning and life goes on. Maybe I'll get some canes
        for lunch.
        Thanks for your time.

        Do y'all have catchphrases/"unique" things y'all say? Do I need to put trigger warnings here? I'm personally not
        a fan. I understand why they exist, do they need to be here? I'm a bit biased. I got to experience the tumblring
        of 2012. Good christ what a shitty time. Not like socially or on the greater scale, just for me. I was peaking
        in cringe angsty teen energy then. While also being the saxophone section leader in marching band. Is that a funny
        mental image? Just some emo punk ass waxing poetically about the man while learning ballet and trying to memorize
        music. I played the bari so it was easy enough everytime. Anyways in lieu of "I'm going to/I want to kill myself"
        I'll say "I want to blast my fucking dick off". I think even as a perfectly healthy and sound individual, one hundred
        percent knowingly using hyperbole, it's bad energy to put out maaan. Have you ever been blamed for a suicide? I
        think I'd rather just pull the gd trigger. Just a way more direct and rational cause and effect. It's a tragedy
        that one will never <i>truly</i> know how much love is out there. Also lame that love is such a subjective amorphous
        thing. I had so many ideas I wanted to talk about last night. I should write my ideas down. I think preplanning
        defeats the purpose of a stream of consciousness though. Is this even stream of consciousness? I definitely censor
        myself.  Such a hypocrite. I mean, not every idea is justified in being shared. God this makes me sound like some
        closeted raging racist or some shit. Would that be a surprise? I would sure hope so. There is a certain irremovable
        stench on these pretentious internet goblins though. Maybe it's literally a shower. I should take one. Anyways like
        anything, I'm really not even <i>that</i> online. Such a poser I need to stop forcing my way. All that to say,
        I'm not one of <i>those</i> internet "the world sucks my life is lame woe is me" guys. I mean it's not fucking
        rocket surgery. What is it now? The top .01% globally are at equivalent holdings to the bottom 50% of the <b>world</b>???
        Jamie pull up a source for that cite me real quick. "Oh my god everything's expensive there are no jobs I never
        got educated my liver is failing and I don't have insurance because of this my wife left me... this is definitely
        because of the trans agenda." Are you actually fucking stupid bro? Maybe it's the asshole <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> on <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>?
        I "try not to talk about politics" here but that's only because everything is so gd stupid now. Like actually.
        Modern american politics is like you're either literate or like... ya know? I pray to christ no one tries to fight
        me here. If any trumper has ended up <i>here</i> just blast your fuckin dick off. I just self censored a whole
        paragraph. I know they're watching. That's the romantic view. In reality some nsa database flag gets flipped and
        now my license plate is tracked extra hard. Maybe that's the romantic view and in reality I'm just going to get
        served targeted ads. I "try not to talk about politics" but constantly do. Everything is politics and just looped
        and connected. It always boils down to rich people being fucking dragons. Every time man. "I like your writings"
        has come up multiple times now. Wild. Actually what the hell that's so crazy and funny to me. I hated and was awful
        at all my writing classes. Except a technical writing class I took in college. That was basically just making a
        resume though. Also wild because like... I don't think this stuff is actually particularly interesting, unique,
        enlightening. Maybe entertaining? Not like tv entertaining but like when you're watching a bird try to fly off
        with a giant chunk of food. "What's he even trying to do?" I ask myself the same question sometimes. Do you ever
        think I'm talking to <b>you</b>? Or is this always a collective us/we? Sometimes when I ask questions in these
        ramblings it's directed at a specific person. Is this bad for me? I wonder if maintaining this online persona
        clashes too hard with the "real" me. Is the real me the version that goes to work? That'd be lame. What do I mean
        by that? Why is barndoors so siloed from brandon's life? Typing my own name is weird. Just because to me I'm obviously
        me, the I. It's weird to think I exist for y'all. It's easy to be like "ya some people stop by and read my yapping
        every once in a while." But sooo weird to think of it from the other side. Like to y'all I exist as a person
        yapping about... whatever goes on here. Life? Maybe it's closer to an ant farm or aquarium. I get that. Sometimes
        it's fun to just focus on one guy and see what he's up to. "Why is my sim always on the fucking computer? Go do
        your dishes bro." I get it. I just joined a meeting. Can I multitask? I wish I could talk about <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>.
        I don't even think <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> knows how impactful they've been
        in my life. Can I just... say it? Ha. Hahaha. Do y'all want to hear about my relationships? Probably not. I have
        one insane story I want to tell. Man. This is so embarrassing. I can't even bring myself to do it. Just a teaser.
        Believe it or not, I interact with women. That in of itself makes me laugh. This one woman told me I could be a model.
        I've clung to that comment for years. Men don't get a ton of compliments. I feel like I get more than the average
        man. A lot of that is like because I go fishing for it. Do I give off some sort of like pity-able vibe? Maybe
        people are just nice. I think a lot about like what is the average interaction with a straight dude like for women. Is it
        that horrible? Shut up bro you have 25 neocities followers. I'm on
        instagram too. Why did I even say that? I don't even use it. Some of y'all have sent me emails. I owe you replies.
        My issue is that like this is all such a larp. Ya know? Irl me is just <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        bowls and playing cyberpunk. I'm finally in dogtown. I'm sleeping under a pile of clean but unfolded laundry and
        worrying about cooking my chicken thighs properly. I'm good at rendering out the fats and getting a crispy skin,
        just constantly undercooking the interior. Not in the chicken anxiety way either just actually undercooking.
        Anyways all that to say when you send me an email with big ass words and references and smart ass book shit my
        flight responses get triggered. Luckily I'm an inbox zero kinda person, so it sits in my inbox. Waiting. Taunting.
        I have to "turn on" the brains. I am <i>actually</i> so stupid in my day to day I'm not even kidding guys. As much
        as I bitch, usually the most stressful thing I do is savescum rolls in baldur's gate. I'm playing a bard. I <i>want</i>
        to think more and be able to quickly reply but maaan. Path of least resistance. What's on tiktok? I'm actually spending
        way less time there. Thanks for bullying me benny. You're such a sweetheart lol. Comments stick! Especially when
        you're objectively right. You you. Not me you. What about some music to start the week? What's the vibe. Send me
        your indie coffee shop sad girl music. But first can you do me a favor and
        <a href="https://youtu.be/RoKItFLK3xs">
            shake ya ass, but watch yourself.
            Shake ya ass, SHOW ME WHAT YOU WORKIN WITH.

        I used to never sweat death now I trip about it because life's too good for me to even live without it. Y'all make
        me laugh. Such kind people. I'm alive awake alert enthusiastic. I'm alive awake alert enthusiastic. I'm alive awake
        alert I'm alert awake alive I'm alive awake alert enthusiastic. Holy shit maybe too much so I just spilled hot coffee
        all over myself. My parents gave me a giant bag of tootsie rolls that have been in their pantry since ????. What
        a lame candy. Personally can't say it's the worst though. Anyways they're much smaller than I remember. Shrinkflation?
        Perception? Direction correction. I've just been putting one in my coffee every morning. It feels wrong to throw
        them out ya know? But at the same time... they're tootsie rolls. Man we made a candy tierlist at one point. Damn
        I can't find it. Might be one of the ones that just never got saved anyways. Off the dome I guess. Visualizing.
        Tootsie rolls have to be a mid-low c tier. Bottom of f would be something black licorice I think. Salt water taffy
        right above that. Mounds/almond joy blows. I don't like shredded coconut. That's a lie samoas fuckin slap. Anyways
        S tier has to be reese's and peanut m&ms. Snickers are pretty good. Ok guys. It's reese's not reese-eez.
        Reese apostrophe s. The candy of reese. Reeseez pieceez ok et. Oh man actually those mango peelerz are very good.
        I could put those in s tier too. I miss cakes and pastries. I really miss biscuits and gravy. I miss being super
        lazy in the evening and just having to boil a pot of water for dinner. I do feel so much better though. Physically
        anyways. Not at the moment actually I'm dealing with the gluten-ing from the past couple weeks right now. But
        generally so. Maybe that's why my stats have been so wack recently. It's more of a habit thing really. I got in
        the habit of killing all my constructive habits. At least my /stats aren't <i>completely</i> blank this month
        like they were last. For real guys please help email or post ideas on where to go for my sabbatical for real please.
        An international trip would be fun (and needed) but I'm a bit "concerned". First a month plus away from my beautiful
        baby boy cutie puppy man would be heartbreaking... and expensive probably. He's an actual rat. No one's fighting
        to spend more time with him. Finance wise I think it'd end up "only" being a couple weeks. Which would be very
        dope. Let's take a moment to do our land acknowledgements. So privileged. Anyways that's something I could (haven't
        but could) do at "any time". Maybe that's excuses. Anyways the other plan is just a mega road trip. Take the pup
        and just drive around the country for a month. We couldn't go to the parks which is lame. Not the cool part of
        cool parks anyways? Most of them? Something like that. Half and half? Am I indecisive? What a funny question to
        ask. It'd be in august. I wish I could <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>. But <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>. I don't think <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> anyways. How did we meet? It's been a while how
        have you been? Cathing up sucks. Why can't we stay caught up? I complain as if I'm not one half of every relationship.
        I'm so unfriendly. When people hear that from me they tend to "get defensive" and start glazing. Like when I say
        I'm objectively not a good person. Chill. I'm not mean. I'm not a bad person. Ya know? Like to me a good person
        <i>does</i> good. I don't know could easily argue being a neutral force nowadays is objectively bad. Maybe I'm
        just not a flashy asshole blabbin about how I saved the world by sharing a facebook post? What a weird future
        to end up in. I can't imagine what the kiddos are going through. The lil builtin gmail chat was the shit afterschool.
        I remember being so gd hyped to get a phone with <i>texting</i> because it meant constant access to the homies.
        Did you ever get poked? <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> had a lil computer lab by
        the battle bots(?) setup. That's where I made my first runescape account. One time in portland(?) I got monsters inc
        for the gba out of a local shop. I couldn't figure it out so we went back and the guy just had a bin I could
        exchange it for. I thought that was the future of gaming. It's like (lord forgive me for the sin of cringe) the
        dumbest parts from idiocracy and cyberpunk, just no double jump and starbucks just serves coffee. Way too easy
        to complain about how things are now. And again, I'm not a good person what am I doing about it. Just complaining
        on this lame ass blog. Or <i>am</i> I? The amount of people that post their crimes online is insane. Like... just
        don't do that part guys. At <i>best</i> you get a single batch of a million views ya? Maybe? Ideally don't post
        anything online. Scroll down we've already established I'm a hypocrite. I wonder what the ideal human lifestyle
        is in the modern day? Like if we've developed faster than we've biologically evolved, what is a peak day to day
        for our brains? I love those videos where it's some absolutely stunning mountain view and the caption is "humans
        saw this and developed story points". What do <b>you</b> think reader? Is this blog post a 3 or a 5? If it was me
        it would be a 2 but if someone else grabbed this it could balloon up to an 8; getting them all spun up and such.
        Let's touch base after this meeting. Wait actually I have another one after this. We'll circle back in the afternoon.
        Thanks for your time.

        Werewolf but instead it's a monday cup of coffee turning me into garfield. Please dear god go checkout the main
        site. It's all fresh. Too much effort. I like the colors a lot more. The page animations tie things together nicely.
        I think the way I render stuff is a bit jankier but it works so who cares? I mean even if it didn't work who would
        care? I think the biggest downside to the update is now each of these entries takes more page width. In turn making
        each entry look a lot shorter than before. Why does that bother me? I think it shows I don't write as much (and
        therefore don't think as much) as I'd like to. I feel selfish having feelings. I wonder if it was how I was raised.
        There's no <i>way</i> events in my formative years impacted my formation. Too easy of an excuse. I objectively had
        a good childhood. Just some emo punk ass little jerk. I miss feeling desired. Yo pause this is a separate thought
        than the ones about my childhood. I wish someone thought I was a cool existence. <b>Boooo</b> get off the stage and talk about
        the site! Why the hell did it take so long man? Fair.
        I took the leap and <b>rewrote</b> the entire thing using astro. The framing and component-ing didn't take too long.
        I was rendering janky js components before. The biggest issues during setup were related to the hydra pieces. Managing
        state for all of them was a bit of a pain. Just new issues when entering the spa I guess. I should have taken some
        notes. I wonder how much I actually learned from that. Anyways the next mega time sink was reediting ALL the pics.
        Plus adding like 50 more. I went overkill on all the profile pics. The worst part was actually the /art page. I
        didn't (and still don't) save the originals in a set location. When I reedit these I have to grab new ones or refind
        the sources. I still didn't this time around. Hoping the theme sticks around for longer. I considered doing some
        sort of global filtering but wasn't vibing with any of the results. I figured out a few helpful workflow tweaks
        which sped things up. Still a pain. That went smoothly though, just took way too long. The last issue I had was
        the gd internet itself. What a web of wizardry. To me anyways. I got caught up in dns and redirect land for a full
        day. "Luckily" no one visits my site. There's not a ton of reason to revisit I guess. It's just a portfolio and
        once you see it you see it huh? I'm supposed to be writing documentation right now. I'd rather ramble here. It's
        funny how my existence is really writing words <i>nobody</i> will read. No offence. I know some people read this
        at least. Weirder I guess how the words that people read don't pay my bills at all. Like the stuff literally
        actually for really real going into a void give me a dwelling. I need to get my finances in order. In order-er I
        guess. Man what the hell am I here complaining about. My default mental state is so negative. Sheeesh. I guess
        I don't want to like introduce characters and build too much lore here. That's where all the fun stuff happens.
        Computers make me absolutely miserable and I love them so much. Journaling in a closed irl space would probably
        be healthier. But it's so lame to make that shit all pretttttyyyy. I'm gonna be sitting around with stamps and
        stickers and shit? That's soooo lame. Firing up an ide and pushing "code" everytime is definitely way better. I'm
        already committed to just writing shit straight to /index. I've thought about doing individual files and linking
        and all that buuuut this is easy enough. Like the automate-able stuff wouldn't save me any time overall. Would be
        a nicer view for any nerds using the inspector... for some reason. Maybe the book viewer? I have yet to use my
        tablet for anything other than a second monitor. I'm sure it could help in my 3d flow. Just need to look into apps
        and stuff I guess. Speaking of managing finances I've been doing a bit of research into treating myself. I'm thinking
        of stepping out of my comfort zone a bit and... are you ready? This is crazy but I'm thinking of buying myself some
        clothes. I know I know it's wild and crazy but the free rec center tshirt is disintegrating, kanye isn't cool*, and
        the $15 walmart pants shed more than the dog. The last time I seriously spent racks on clothes is when I went on
        a small national park circuit and copped a shirt from all the gift shops. I talk as if I'm frugal at all. My electricity
        bill is insane for a single person. Not even talking about the initial investment on all these screens and devices.
        Have y'all ever heard the phrase "whatever floats your peaches?" I think about that phrase a lot. I had to add
        commas in the dates because they were reading as phone numbers on mobile. I'm sure there's a smart way to tell the
        browser not to but throwing a few commas down was easy enough. Path of least resistance. Sometimes I feel so smart.
        That's no good. I'm going to continue being miserable and gluten myself for lunch with some leftovers.
        Thanks for your time.

        *When tlop was leaked "2020 ima run the whole election YAH!" made me laugh so hard. I know I know he wasn't that

        Ya know, everyone I've met who said they can suck their own dick has said it feels more like sucking a dick than
        getting your dick sucked. My birthday was on <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>! I got
        a couple ram sticks and quality time with <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>. "Quality
        time". How do you know when you're officially wasting time? Are people really that sure of themselves? Why is it
        weird when I'm sure of things? I guess the mistake is thinking people actually think like me. I know it's a psyop.
        Why do I fall for it? There's a bit of comfort in knowing you're getting tricked. A lot of anxiety in <i>thinking</i>
        so too. How would I rate this year? Pretty lame. I didn't leave the country for any travel, interior traveling was
        all fairly lame, health issues, work, etc. First world problems shut up who cares. I <i>did</i> make it another year
        at least. That's what I want to celebrate. I get more and more worried that no one <i>gets it</i>. I'd love to
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        while getting <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> in nature. Why is everything SO expensive?
        Don't give me an actual history/sociology/economics lesson. I'm too stupid for that. I'm just going off of *feelings*.
        I was going to put emojis but decided on something a bit less obtrusive. Obstructive? Did you guys ever watch the
        oblongs? I remember "watching" it a few times in my cousin's basement. Uncle's basement? Prick. I wonder if they
        actually read this. It's kinda funny I always tell people "if you read this that's fine just don't tell me about
        it please dear god" but I'm constantly searching for acknowledgements. Am I dumb? Do I ask myself too many questions?
        Why can't I ever turn that around and ask other people what's going on? Why doesn't anyone tell me anything? I'm
        trapped in an enclosure. I built it myself. I'm actually quite proud of its construction and aesthetic. Insert compliment
        here. I'm too fried. What was drug reduction like growing up for y'all? Did I experience any for real? It couldn't
        have been more than a single class period. I'm always curious why anyone's here. Is it really the rambling? At first
        I thought it'd be for the random projects. I originally started this because I just wanted a "safe" space to complain
        about my totally awful terrible miserable job. Is my main site even portfolio-able? Who cares I guess. I'm cooked.
        Game over. So like what are we? Why can't everyone just selectively read my mind? I want everything to be easy
        and perfect. Conflict and strife is sooo <span class="b">2020</span>. Is this healthy? For anyone? Sometimes I convince myself I'm a
        people pleaser. Some type of martyr that's actually improving anyone's livelihood. Wouldn't that require some
        people to actually be pleased? Thank god. An elephant never forgets. I'm so gd cold right now. What did (does) it
        mean to you? Maybe I'm the one that needs to be reading minds. I like to yap. No one listens. Which is fine. It's
        kinda lame but I don't want to be all "woe is me life is so rough". It never is. For me. What privilege. That could
        evaporate literally at any second. Maybe I shouldn't jinx it. Historically I've been lucky I guess. Do y'all
        believe in like astrology/tarot stuff? I can't say I "believe" it. I think it's fair to earn weird looks. The way
        I see it is like, let's say you're pulling your cards ya? If the entire time you're thinking "oh man I hope <i>xyz</i>"
        then the <i>xyz</i> is like the foundation for meditation material. <i>Why</i> were you wishing for <i>xyz</i>?
        Is that worth anything? I guess the astrology side is different. That's supposedly kinda set. I still giggle about
        "...you have a name?" I really think I wish I didn't. I don't know. Some sort of aethereal entity. I still want to
        update this shitty "blog" (?) whatever this is but like, I could do without a legal name, taxes, employment, etc.
        Why can't I just exist with no strife man??? If I didn't make my own problems I'd just rot away truly. At least I
        get to "fix things". Y'all didn't like those song lyrics? You had to be there to get it I guess. Never any replies.
        Just yappin into the void. Hey siri play some fuckin uhhhh chuck berry please. At least johnny could fuckin shred
        it right? Thanks for your time.

        Walking around with my eyes sewn shut. Passing by the most beautiful things in the world like "so what"?
        Find an empty spot on a curb and post up next to a homeless man, cart full of soda cans, smiling.
        How's he in a better mood than I am in? When I'm an inch away from achieving my dreams?
        There's different types of achievement it seems. The intravenous needle fiends to the people that dream of seeing
        themselves up on the screens. We all tryna chase a high. What is it with human beings? We're never satisfied.
        My only conclusion's confusion and my only solution is the illusion I create through boozin.
        <br><br>
        Fuck it.
        <br><br>
        My eyes open. I pop my tall beer. Toast to los angeles. We all here. From skid row to the names up in the blaring
        lights. I take a sip and I'm headed straight to paradise. Every day I battle with my inner consciousness. Trying to
        get him to become an optimist. Trying to convince him god exists and to focus on the positive and take pride in
        my accomplishments. But he only speaks. He doesn't hear. A radio newsfeed always in my ear and I just wish that
        it would disappear. It's an embodiment of all my insecurities and fear, and it keeps me wide awake lying late at
        night nervous. Mind racing. Contemplating life's purpose. But isn't that a contemplation that is quite worthless?
        And I'm still awake when the sunlight surface. I just
        <br><br>
        relax,
        <br>
        lie still,
        <br>
        count sheep,
        <br>
        drink nyquil.
        <br><br>
        "Lord, help me sleep", I say a prayer at night and in my dreams I'm going straight to paradise. Too much time
        alone, all I think about is death. I'm a chain smoker, how much time I got left? I swear there's something wrong
        going on inside my chest and I ain't seen a doctor. I should probably get a test. I just wish I wasn't confident
        in an afterlife. If it turned out that I was wrong, I'd be dead, it wouldn't matter, right? I drink too much,
        for the numbness. I think too much, but yearn for dumbness. I wish that I was satisfied by the cars, the restaurants,
        and maître d's. <b>I love steak. Put me back inside the matrix please.</b> We can all talk about the weather

        Fuck you lasagna vibes. I'm off this week. My mind has been empty for the past however long. Not in my normal
        "I have nothing to say yet must shout into the void" empty. Like EMPTY empty. I couldn't even really say why.
        Work has been a bit rough recently. Maybe rougher than normal? Hard to gauge. I dove back into cyberpunk. That's
        about it though. No new art. You can even check the stats. Sheeesh even skipping my morning stretches. In cyberpunk
        I'm playing a corpo. Do you play as a man or a woman in games with the choice? Do you always choose the same sex,
        either to irl you or across games? It's sex right? Not gender? Sorry I'm not WOKE ok libs??? Not enough anyways.
        Woke. The woke mind virus fucked my wife. The woke mind virus stole my job. Did y'all see all those maga twitter
        accounts were <i>actually</i> international psyops? Wow. Who would've thought. There's no medals. I wasn't (and
        continue to not be) smart enough to capitalize on anything. Gross. What would that even look like anyways? I'm sure
        all of this will get cleared up once ai is...out? So what are we waiting for again? Did altman really say we're
        going to build agi then ask it how to make money? What does that even actually mean? Why couldn't we keep computers
        pure. The idea of wanting to curse them with consciousness (as the ultimate goal). Sad. Would you vouch for computer
        rights? Would we get a choice? I mean at that super crazy scifi future point. Because it's not like all our devices
        would be individuals. I don't think so anyways. I imagine it'd be a more central entity kind of thing. Brooo what
        if that's what we are. Is it right to create that? Are we created? I have beef with god. At least big g christian
        god. Seems like a real dick ya know? If it were scientifically proven that christian god existed 100% I still
        wouldn't be able to worship. Ya know? Just because like... I don't know. Apologist justifications to me just feel
        like the architect at <i>best</i>. If I'm made in his image wouldn't he be a <i>little</i> nicer? I'm not even
        talking about myself in some "I deserve everything" kind of way. Not here anyways. I guess like empathy and compassion
        aside I refuse <i>this</i> is part of a plan from some all knowing being. You're gonna tell me god wanted nfts and
        crypto bros? Really? Again not even talking about the real tragedies of the world. Things feel <i>so</i> stupid.
        <i>I</i> feel so stupid. I shouldn't project so hard. Again, empty mind for whatever. I haven't been thinking.
        Or trying to think. At least past matrix mode living. At least I'm off this week. Fuck you lasagna vibes. Thanks for your time.

        So, there's a man crawling through the desert ya? He'd decided to try his suv in a little bit of cross country
        travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he
        couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless.
        He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.
        <br><br>
        He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty.
        He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out
        which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd
        be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last. He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun,
        but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that
        he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication
        later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the suv with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle
        in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the
        direction he thinks is right.
        <br><br>
        He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's
        been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and
        whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.
        <br><br>

        He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.
        <br><br>

        By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the
        town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't
        remember coming through it in the suv. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the
        dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll
        start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.

        As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,
        he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.

        Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back
        up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.

        He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.
        <br><br>

        He knows the Rule of Threes:
        <br><br>

        three minutes without air,
        <br><br>
        three days without water,
        <br><br>
        three weeks without food - then you die.
        <br><br>

        Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.

        He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in
        his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't
        find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.

        Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.

        Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.

        As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.
        <br><br>

        He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait
        any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large
        rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly
        swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry
        and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes
        another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.
        He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to
        make some difference and keep himself from passing out.

        He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,
        it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty
        sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.

        He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,
        dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.
        Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.

        After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat
        stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.

        After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He
        knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the suv - he remembers doing
        donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy
        enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers anymore or if
        he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,
        trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.
        <br><br>

        He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure anymore. He's not even sure how long he's been walking anymore. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.

        He walks through the sand.

        After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't
        remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his suv. Or at least he
        doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.

        But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures
        that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from
        there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.

        Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third
        time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll
        just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.

        While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally
        gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through
        the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert
        in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any
        rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -
        shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.
        <br><br>

        He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,
        he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees
        is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he
        sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more
        dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his suv. This is Hell. Or close enough.

        Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper
        fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the
        cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from
        here. He's going to have to go down there and look.

        He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.
        After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.
        <br><br>

        He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough
        energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When
        he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot
        in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.

        So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins
        to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to
        have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages
        of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't
        have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last
        chance.

        He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the
        dark area. His eyes won't quite focus anymore for some reason. And lifting
        his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just
        keeps crawling.
        <br><br>

        Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,
        where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone
        area.

        His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark
        stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun
        overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying
        down on the nice cool surface.

        Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's
        probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and
        dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the
        beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him
        a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.

        He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here
        in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the
        center before he goes. He keeps crawling.

        It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's
        hearing. He would swear that someone just said, "Greetings, traveler. You do
        not look well. Do you hear me?"
        <br><br>

        He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and
        knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something
        different. He leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few
        seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and
        tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands
        and tries again. Better this time.

        Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse
        of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or
        pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet
        out of the stone, at an angle.

        And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and
        seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a 15' long
        desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.

        He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and
        run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his
        final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to
        move from this spot.

        Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than
        dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a
        little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves
        it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a
        moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.

        Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -
        that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.

        He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here
        because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was
        likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was
        now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had
        actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white
        post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe
        they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake
        was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.
        <br><br>

        He tries to clear his throat to say, "Hello," but his throat is too dry. All
        that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going
        to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the
        bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,
        almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't
        good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes
        out.

        He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,
        and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then
        swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk
        now.

        He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to
        spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, "Hello? Is there anyone here?"

        He hears, from his side, "Greetings. What is it that you want?"

        He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed
        to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a
        speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides
        to try asking for help.

        "Please," he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, "I'd love to not be
        thirsty anymore. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?"

        Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was
        coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its
        mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he
        falls forward, face first on the stone, "Very well. Coming up."
        <br><br>

        A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits
        up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily
        disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the
        sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped
        around the tilted white post, still looking at him.

        He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.
        He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder
        again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -
        they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been
        bitten. By the snake.

        "It'll feel better in a minute." He looks up - it's the snake talking. He
        hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy anymore. And more
        importantly, he's not thirsty anymore - at all!

        "Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the
        afterlife?"

        "Sorry about that, but I had to bite you," says the snake. "That's the way I
        work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine."

        "You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty anymore? Did you give me a
        drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be
        thirsty anymore? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for
        the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?
        Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?"

        "No," says the snake, "I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I
        didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I
        bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just
        sitting around here."
        <br><br>

        The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the
        desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a
        snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not
        great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no
        longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt
        hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool
        stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer
        dying of thirst.

        "I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your
        system with the next request," continued the snake. "I can guess why you
        drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left
        in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or
        two, if you drank enough of it."

        "Ummm, n-next request?" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting
        shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.
        <br><br>

        "That's the way it works. If you like, that is," explained the snake. "You
        get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish." The snake grinned at his
        own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.

        "But there are rules," the snake continued. "The first request is free. The
        second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of
        responsibility." The snake looks at the man seriously.

        "By the way," the snake says suddenly, "my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,
        Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the bound
        used to just call me 'snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand
        for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into
        names. You can call me Nate, if you wish." Again, the snake grinned. "Sorry
        if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds
        somewhat threatening." The snake give his rattle a little shake.

        "Umm, my name is Jack," said the man, trying to absorb all of this. "Jack
        samson.

        "Can I ask you a question?" Jack says suddenly. "What happened to the
        poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?
        What do you mean by that's how you work?"

        "That's more than one question," grins Nate. "But I'll still try to answer
        all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question." The snake's grin gets
        wider. "Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need
        to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not
        be thirsty anymore - but 'anymore' is such a vague term. I decided to make
        it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at
        all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to
        get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.
        You've been changed.

        "For the third question," Nate continues, "you are still dying. Besides the
        effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.
        In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.
        Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is." Nate seemed vastly
        amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.

        "As for the fourth question," Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack
        could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read
        talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, "first you have to agree
        to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell
        you."

        "Wait," joked Jack, "isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd
        have to kill me?"

        "I thought that was implied." Nate continued to look serious.

        "Ummm...yeah." Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was
        talking to a 15' poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a
        nasty temper. "So, what is this 'bound by secrecy' stuff, and can you really
        stop the effects of the methanol?" Jack thought for a second. "And, what do
        you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper
        fluid, and just denature it?"

        "They may, I don't really know," said Nate. "I haven't gotten out in a
        while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and
        on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you
        pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume
        that they still color wiper fluid blue?"

        "Yeah, they do," said Jack.

        "I figured," replied Nate. "As for being bound by secrecy - with the
        fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,
        this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you
        decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,
        write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will
        lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of
        course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm
        guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding
        anyway, so you won't notice." Nate said the last part with utter confidence.
        <br><br>

        Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a
        little nervous at this. "Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know
        that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?"

        Well, Jack," said Nate sadly, "I can't tell you that, unless you make the
        second request." Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.

        "Umm, well, ok," said Jack, "what is this about a second request? What can I
        ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?"

        "Sure!" said Nate, brightening. "You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes
        to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and
        before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or
        omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous
        and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and
        sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be
        omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very
        useful, at least in my opinion." Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was
        staring at him.

        "Well, anyway," continued Nate, "I'd probably suggest giving you permanent
        good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be
        immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long
        time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to
        recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a
        request to me."

        "Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?" said Jack. "And keep me healthy for a
        long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request
        about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not
        really a change to me?"

        "Right," nodded Nate.

        "Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?" Jack asked, hopefully.

        "That takes two requests, Jack."

        "Yeah, I figured so," said Jack. "But I could ask to be a genius? I could
        become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?"

        "Well, I could make you very smart," admitted Nate, "but that wouldn't
        necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you
        very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.
        You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some
        truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It
        all depends on what you decide to do with it."

        "Hmmm," said Jack. "Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,
        after this one?"

        "Maybe," said Nate, "it depends on what you decide then. There are more
        rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second
        request. You know how it goes." Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had
        shoulders.

        "Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent
        health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.
        Do I need to sign in blood or something?"

        "No," said Nate. "Just hold out your hand. Or heel." Nate grinned. "Or
        whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,
        that's how it works - the poison, you know," Nate said apologetically.

        Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it
        didn't hurt anymore. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better
        about the biting business. But still, standing still while a 15'
        snake sunk its fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to
        be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack
        tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it
        wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.

        "Hey, Jack," Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind
        him, "is that someone else coming up over there?"

        Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of
        nowhere? And did they bring food?

        Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...

        Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through
        his jeans...

        Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. "I would have
        decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to
        hoodwink me like that."

        "I've been doing this a long time, Jack," said Nate, confidently. "You
        humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -
        especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of
        minutes and it already doesn't hurt anymore, does it? That's because of the
        health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now."

        "Yeah, well, still," said Jack, "it's the principle of the thing. And nobody
        likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or
        something instead?"

        "More meat in the typical human butt," replied Nate. "And less chance you
        accidentally kick me or move at the last second."

        "Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify
        to hear," answered Jack.

        "Ok," said Nate. "Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to
        just start talking?"

        "Just talk," said Jack. "I'll sit here and try to not think about food."

        "We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,"
        answered Nate.

        "Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!" Jack jumped up.
        "What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically
        whip up food along with your other powers?" Jack was almost shouting with
        excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.

        "I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite
        it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,
        that is," replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.

        "Ugh," said Jack, sitting back down. "I think I'll pass. I can last a little
        longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it
        is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.
        No thanks. Just talk."

        "Ok," replied Nate, still grinning. "But I'd better hurry, before you start
        looking at me as food.

        Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.
        "You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden."

        Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate
        sceptically.

        "Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack," said Nate. "Stand up
        and look at the symbol on the rock here." Nate gestured around the dark
        stone they were both sitting on with his nose.

        Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a
        representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around
        was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches
        left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it
        looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and
        embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.

        Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the
        setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the
        sky.
        <br><br>

        Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another
        night out here! Arrrgh!

        Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and
        stood next to Nate. "In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate," said
        Jack. "Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to
        have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw
        desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to."

        "It's about 30 miles that way." Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail
        this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to
        the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. "But that's 30 miles by
        the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be
        able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head
        out early tomorrow, Jack."

        Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and
        then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading
        out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting
        stuff. "Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?"

        "Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway," said Nate. "He
        figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a
        'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he
        could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from
        across the ocean. He worried about that for a while."

        "Garden of eden, huh?" said Jack. "How long have you been here, Nate?"

        "No idea, really," replied Nate. "A long time. It never occurred to me to
        count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I
        do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands
        of years, at least."

        "So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?" said Jack.

        "Beats me," said Nate. "Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your
        kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it
        could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant
        requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals."

        "Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out
        of the stone there?" asked Jack.

        "Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much
        bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember
        if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But
        one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do
        something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've
        been here ever since.

        "What is this place?" said Jack. "And what did he ask you to do?"
        <br><br>

        "Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?" Nate loosened his
        coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into
        the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to
        enter the stone in an 18" slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned
        over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as
        Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but
        Nate was suddenly there in the way.

        "You can't touch that yet, Jack," said Nate.

        "Why not?" asked Jack.

        "I haven't explained it to you yet," replied Nate.

        "Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something," said Jack. "You'd push it
        that way, and it would move in the slot."

        "Yep, that's what it is," replied Nate.

        "What does it do?" asked Jack. "End the world?"
        <br><br>

        "Oh, no," said Nate. "Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it
        'The Lever of Doom'." For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing
        voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and
        grinned.

        Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned
        Jack laughed. "Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it
        really do?"

        "Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said," smirked Nate. "I just thought
        the voice I used was funny, didn't you?"

        Nate continued to grin.
        <br><br>

        "A lever to end humanity?" asked Jack. "What in the world is that for? Why
        would anyone need to end humanity?"

        "Well," replied Nate, "I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.
        Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really
        bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are
        the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I
        didn't think to ask back when I started here."

        "Rules? What rules?" asked Jack.

        "The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it
        unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human
        can be bound in that way at a time. That's it." explained Nate.

        Jack looked somewhat shocked. "You mean that I could pull the lever now?
        You'd let me end humanity?"

        "Yep," replied Nate, "if you want to." Nate looked at Jack carefully. "Do
        you want to, Jack?"

        "Umm, no." said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. "Why in
        the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want
        that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,
        wouldn't it?"

        "Yep," replied Nate, "being as he'd be human too."

        "Has anyone ever seriously considered it?" asked Nate. "Any of those bound
        to secrecy, that is?"

        "Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or
        another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and
        think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get
        disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.
        But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here." Nate grinned some more.

        Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at
        the same time. After a bit, he said, "So this makes me the Judge of
        humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?"

        "That seems to be it," agreed Nate.

        "What kind of criteria do I use to decide?" said Jack. "How do I make this
        decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are
        bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?"

        "Nope," replied Nate. "You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's
        up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed
        to know."

        "But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel
        horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?"
        protested Jack.

        Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. "You don't. You just have to
        try your best, Jack."

        Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly
        getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.

        Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. "Nate, was Samuel the
        one bound to this before me?"

        "Yep," replied Nate. "He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to
        read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried
        in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months
        ago."

        "Sounds like a good guy," agreed Jack. "How did he handle this, when you
        first told him. What did he do?"

        "Well," said Nate, "he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and
        then asked me some questions, much like you're doing."

        "What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?" asked Jack.

        "He asked me about the third request," replied Nate.

        "Aha!" It was Jack's turn to grin. "And what did you tell him?"

        "I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request
        you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point
        that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here
        and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out." Nate looked serious
        again. "And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack."

        "Hmmm." Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.

        Nate watched him, waiting.

        "Nate," continued Jack, quietly, eventually. "What did Samuel ask for with
        his third request?"

        Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,
        "Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him."

        "Ok," said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, "give it
        to me.

        Nate looked at Jack's backside. "Give you what, Jack?"

        "Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped
        him, maybe it'll help me too." Jack turned his head to look back over his
        shoulder at Nate. "It did help him, right?"

        "He said it did," replied Nate. "But he seemed a little quieter afterward.
        Like he had a lot to think about."

        "Well, yeah, I can see that," said Jack. "So, give it to me." Jack turned to
        face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.

        Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,
        Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.

        "You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like
        it needs it, right Jack?" asked Nate, shifting position.

        "Yeah, yeah, I got that," replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body
        tense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.

        "And," continued Nate, from his new position, "do you remember that you'll
        turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?"

        "Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!" said Jack, opening his eyes,
        straightening up and turning around. "Purple?!" He didn't see Nate there.
        With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot
        in the rock without the snake wrapped around it.

        Jack heard, from behind him, Nate's "Just Kidding!" right before he felt the
        now familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock.

        Jack sat on the edge of the dark stone in the rapidly cooling air, his feet
        extending out into the sand. He stared out into the darkness, listening to
        the wind stir the sand, occasionally rubbing his butt where he'd been
        recently bitten.

        Nate had left for a little while, had come back with a desert-rodent-shaped
        bulge somewhere in his middle, and was now wrapped back around the lever,
        his tongue flicking out into the desert night's air the only sign that he
        was still awake.

        Occasionally Jack, with his toes absentmindedly digging in the sand while he
        thought, would ask Nate a question without turning around.
        <br><br>

        "Nate, do accidents count?"

        Nate lifted his head a little bit. "What do you mean, Jack?"

        Jack tilted his head back like he was looking at the stars. "You know,
        accidents. If I accidentally fall on the lever, without meaning to, does
        that still wipe out humanity?"

        "Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does, Jack. I'd suggest you be careful about that
        if you start feeling wobbly," said Nate with some amusement.

        A little later - "Does it have to be me that pulls the lever?" asked Jack.

        "That's the rule, Jack. Nobody else can pull it," answered Nate.

        "No," Jack shook his head, "I meant does it have to be my hand? Could I pull
        the lever with a rope tied around it? Or push it with a stick? Or throw a
        rock?"

        "Yes, those should work," replied Nate. "Though I'm not sure how complicated
        you could get. Samuel thought about trying to build some kind of remote
        control for it once, but gave it up. Everything he'd build would be gone by
        the next sunrise, if it was touching the stone, or over it. I told him that
        in the past others that had been bound had tried to bury the lever so they
        wouldn't be tempted to pull it, but every time the stones or sand or
        whatever had disappeared."

        "Wow," said Jack, "Cool." Jack leaned back until only his elbows kept him
        off of the stone and looked up into the sky.

        "Nate, how long did Samuel live? One of his wishes was for health too,
        right?" asked Jack.

        "Yes," replied Nate, "it was. He lived 167 years, Jack."

        "Wow, 167 years. That's almost 140 more years I'll live if I live as long.
        Do you know what he died of, Nate?"

        "He died of getting tired of living, Jack," Nate said, sounding somewhat
        sad.

        Jack turned his head to look at Nate in the starlight.

        Nate looked back. "Samuel knew he wasn't going to be able to stay in
        society. He figured that they'd eventually see him still alive and start
        questioning it, so he decided that he'd have to disappear after a while. He
        faked his death once, but changed his mind - he decided it was too early and
        he could stay for a little longer. He wasn't very fond of mankind, but he
        liked the attention. Most of the time, anyway.

        "His daughter and then his wife dying almost did him in though. He didn't
        stay in society much longer after that. He eventually came out here to spend
        time talking to me and thinking about pulling the lever. A few months ago he
        told me he'd had enough. It was his time."

        "And then he just died?" asked Jack.

        Nate shook his head a little. "He made his forth request, Jack. There's only
        one thing you can ask for the fourth request. The last bite.

        After a bit Nate continued, "He told me that he was tired, that it was his
        time. He reassured me that someone new would show up soon, like they always
        had.

        After another pause, Nate finished, "Samuel's body disappeared off the stone
        with the sunrise."

        Jack lay back down and looked at the sky, leaving Nate alone with his
        memories. It was a long time until Jack's breathing evened out into sleep.
        <br><br>

        Jack woke with the sunrise the next morning. He was a little chilled with
        the morning desert air, but overall was feeling pretty good. Well, except
        that his stomach was grumbling and he wasn't willing to eat raw desert rat.

        So, after getting directions to town from Nate, making sure he knew how to
        get back, and reassuring Nate that he'd be back soon, Jack started the long
        walk back to town. With his new health and Nate's good directions, he made
        it back easily.
        <br><br>

        Jack caught a bus back to the city, and showed up for work the next day,
        little worse for the wear and with a story about getting lost in the desert
        and walking back out. Within a couple of days Jack had talked a friend with
        a tow truck into going back out into the desert with him to fetch the suv.
        They found it after a couple of hours of searching and towed it back without
        incident. Jack was careful not to even look in the direction of Nate's
        lever, though their path back didn't come within sight of it.

        Before the next weekend, Jack had gone to a couple of stores, including a
        book store, and had gotten his suv back from the mechanic, with a warning to
        avoid anymore joyriding in the desert. On Saturday, Jack headed back to see
        Nate.

        Jack parked a little way out of the small town near Nate, loaded up his new
        backpack with camping gear and the things he was bringing for Nate, and then
        started walking. He figured that walking would leave the least trail, and he
        knew that while not many people camped in the desert, it wasn't unheard of,
        and shouldn't really raise suspicions.

        Jack had brought more books for Nate - recent books, magazines, newspapers.
        Some things that would catch Nate up with what was happening in the world,
        others that were just good books to read. He spent the weekend with Nate,
        and then headed out again, telling Nate that he'd be back again soon, but
        that he had things to do first.
        <br><br>

        Over four months later Jack was back to see Nate again. This time he brought
        a laptop with him - a specially modified laptop. It had a solar recharger,
        special filters and seals to keep out the sand, a satellite link-up, and a
        special keyboard and joystick that Jack hoped that a 15'
        rattlesnake would be able to use. And, it had been hacked to not give out
        its location to the satellite.

        After that Jack could email Nate to keep in touch, but still visited him
        fairly regularly - at least once or twice a year.
        <br><br>

        After the first year, Jack quit his job. For some reason, with the wisdom he'd been given, and the knowledge 
        that he could live for over 150 years,
        working in a 9-5 job for someone else didn't seem that worthwhile
        anymore. Jack went back to school.

        Eventually, Jack started writing. Perhaps because of the wisdom, or perhaps
        because of his new perspective, he wrote well. People liked what he wrote,
        and he became well known for it. After a time, Jack bought an rv and started
        traveling around the country for book signings and readings.

        But, he still remembered to drop by and visit Nate occasionally.
        <br><br>

        On one of the visits Nate seemed quieter than usual. Not that Nate had been
        a fountain of joy lately. Jack's best guess was that Nate was still missing
        Samuel, and though Jack had tried, he still hadn't been able to replace
        Samuel in Nate's eyes. Nate had been getting quieter each visit. But on this
        visit Nate didn't even speak when Jack walked up to the lever. He nodded at
        Jack, and then went back to staring into the desert. Jack, respecting Nate's
        silence, sat down and waited.

        After a few minutes, Nate spoke. "Jack, I have someone to introduce you to."

        Jack looked surprised. "Someone to introduce me to?" Jack looked around, and then looked carefully back at Nate. "This something to do with the Big Guy?

        "No, no," replied Nate. "This is more personal. I want you to meet my son."
        Nate looked over at the nearest sand dune. "Sammy!"

        Jack watched as a 4' long desert rattlesnake crawled from behind the
        dune and up to the stone base of the lever.

        "Yo, Jack," said the new, much smaller snake.

        "Yo, Sammy" replied Jack. Jack looked at Nate. "Named after Samuel, I
        assume?"
        <br><br>

        Nate nodded. "Jack, I've got a favor to ask you. Could you show Sammy around
        for me?" Nate unwrapped himself from the lever and slithered over to the
        edge of the stone and looked across the sands. "When Samuel first told me
        about the world, and brought me books and pictures, I wished that I could go see it. I wanted to see the great forests, the canyons, the cities, even the
        other deserts, to see if they felt and smelled the same. I want my son to
        have that chance - to see the world. Before he becomes bound here like I have been.

        "He's seen it in pictures, over the computer that you brought me. But I hear that it's not the same. That being there is different. I want him to have
        that. Think you can do that for me, Jack?"

        Jack nodded. This was obviously very important to Nate, so Jack didn't even
        joke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world. "Yeah, I can
        do that for you, Nate. Is that all you need?" Jack could sense that was
        something more.

        Nate looked at Sammy. Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said,
        "Oh, yeah. Ummm, I've gotta go pack. Back in a little bit Jack. Nice to meet
        ya!" Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight.

        Nate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack. "Jack, this is my
        first son. My first offspring through all the years. You don't even want to
        know what it took for me to find a mate." Nate grinned to himself. "But
        anyway, I had a son for a reason. I'm tired. I'm ready for it to be over. I
        needed a replacement."

        Jack considered this for a minute. "So, you're ready to come see the world,
        and you wanted him to watch the lever while you were gone?"
        <br><br>

        Nate shook his head. "No, Jack - you're a better guesser than that. You've
        already figured out - I'm bound here - there's only one way for me to leave
        here. And I'm ready. It's my time to die."

        Jack looked more closely at Nate. He could tell Nate had thought about
        this - probably for quite a while. Jack had trouble imagining what it would
        be like to be as old as Nate, but Jack could already tell that in another
        hundred or two hundred years, he might be getting tired of life himself.
        Jack could understand Samuel's decision, and now Nate's. So, all Jack said
        was, "What do you want me to do?"

        Nate nodded. "Thanks, Jack. I only want two things. One - show Sammy around
        the world - let him get his fill of it, until he's ready to come back here
        and take over. Two - give me the fourth request.

        "I can't just decide to die, not anymore than you can. I won't even die of
        old age like you eventually will, even though it'll be a long time from now.
        I need to be killed. Once Sammy is back here, ready to take over, I'll be
        able to die. And I need you to kill me.

        "I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And
        I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so
        that's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword.

        Nate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind. "I'd
        say an axe, but that's somewhat undignified - putting my head on the ground
        or a chopping block like that. No, I like a sword. A time-honored way of
        going out. A dignified way to die. And, most importantly, it should work,
        even on me.

        "You willing to do that for me, Jack?" Nate turned back to look at Jack.

        "Yeah, Nate," replied Jack solemnly, "I think I can handle that."

        Nate nodded. "Good!" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, "Sammy!
        Jack's about ready to leave!" Then quietly, "Thanks, Jack."
        <br><br>

        Jack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it
        back to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then
        headed into the desert with Sammy following.
        Over the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through
        email as they went about their adventures. They made a goal of visiting
        every country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Sammy had a
        natural gift for languages, as Jack expected he would, and even ended up
        acting as a translator for Jack in a few of the countries. Jack managed to
        keep the talking rattlesnake hidden, even so, and by the time they were
        nearing the end of their tour of countries, Sammy had only been spotted a
        few times. While there were several people that had seen enough to startle
        them greatly, nobody had enough evidence to prove anything, and while a few
        wild rumors and stories followed Jack and Sammy around, nothing ever hit the
        newspapers or the public in general.

        When they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some
        undersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally
        drew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was
        stalling. After talking to his Dad about it over email, he figured out that
        Jack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate. Nate told Sammy that humans
        could be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances.
        <br><br>

        So, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told
        Jack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from
        his dad. Jack, delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to
        Japan and buy an appropriate sword. He even stretched it a little more by
        getting lessons in how to use the sword. But, eventually, he'd learned as
        much as he was likely to without dedicating his life to it, and was
        definitely competent enough to take the head off of a snake. It was time to
        head back and see Nate.
        <br><br>

        When they got back to the US, Jack got the old rv out of storage where he
        and Sammy had left it after their tour of the 50 states, he loaded up
        Sammy and the sword, and they headed for the desert.

        When they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those
        years ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He didn't really feel like
        walking all the way out there. Not only that, but he'd forgotten to
        figure the travel time correctly, and it was late afternoon. They'd either
        have to spend the night in town and walk out tomorrow, or walk in the dark.

        As Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his
        resolve, he decided that he'd go ahead and drive the rv out there. It was
        only going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks
        afterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they
        drove, and then they could get it over tonight.

        Jack told Sammy to email Nate that they were coming as he drove out of
        sight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out
        into the desert.

        Everything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack had been
        nursing the rv along the whole time, over the rocks, through the creek beds,
        revving the engine the few times they almost got stuck. When they came to
        the dunes, Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed
        up the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd
        decided to try driving on the sand. The rv was fishtailling and losing
        traction. Jack was having to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to
        keep from losing control each time they came over the top and slid down the
        other side. Sammy had come up to sit in the passenger seat, coiled up and
        laughing at Jack's driving.
        <br><br>

        As they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw
        that this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate,
        waited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV
        started slipping down the other side.

        Jack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped
        the brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and
        faster.

        Jack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were
        heading for the lever. He looked down - the rv was directly on course for
        it. If Jack didn't do something, the rv would hit it. He was about to end
        humanity.

        Jack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't
        working. The dune was too steep, and the sand too loose. In a split second,
        Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the
        lever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit
        the lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer
        away.

        Jack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the rv a
        little bit - every little bit would help. He'd have to time his turn just
        right.

        The rv got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the
        sand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that
        they were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something
        else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate wasn't wrapped
        around the lever. He was off to the side of the lever, but still on the
        stone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of
        the lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever. The RV
        was already starting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the
        sand and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the
        lever to the other side.

        Jack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the
        lever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy
        realized the same thing.

        Jack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the rv ran up on the stone.
        Shouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, "Better Nate than lever!"

        ""Happy Veterans Day!"" Do y'all have today off? I hope these clouds roll through. I owe benny. I'm busy can't you
        see?! I think I don't like thinking. My calendar is a bit full today. One of these meetings interrupts my dog walk
        schedule. I'm going to add some pages to the main site. I want to have a section for my irl projects. I owe y'all
        working steal my stuff links. Haven't fully visualized that yet. I definitely need to just axe my instagram and link
        too. I don't really <i>get</i> it. I don't want to invest any time or additional information. Just in general
        I guess. I haven't been sleeping well. A lot of dreams recently. Out of the ordinary due to <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>.
        Very lame mundane ones though. What does that say about my mental state? Being asleep/dreaming is everything's
        natural state. Being awake was the weird mutation. Something something triple optics or like connected consciousness
        or whatever. I just want a steak. I actually did cook a few up for lunch yesterday. I hurt my shoulder. I slept
        wrong. I'm sleeping wrong and injuring myself. I'm getting hurt by being asleep incorrectly. Maybe if I stuck to
        my gd morning stretches I'd feel better! Crazy concept. I'm not good at working out sheeesh. Do I live too luxuriously?
        You need to hurt just a little bit. You don't have to but you need to ya know? Which is weird because like what is
        this all for? My last therapist told me to just breathe bro. Like what's that like? I wonder what I'm good at. Not
        what I think I'm good at, or truly believe I'm good at. What am I objectively factually good at? God there's the
        isekai rot seeping in "brooo what if like I had like a stat screen?" I swear I'm not watching any. I even stopped
        getting the tiktok summaries. Blah blah blah I think the important note out of this rambling today is: childish
        gambino acted like an asian teenager on tumblr. Something like that right? Why did bill gates go to the mom
        kardashian's birthday party? I finally beat nightmare 4 in rivals. Can finally uninstall again. No one told me it
        scales with the number of players ok? I figured it scaled a bit but not like that sheesh what a miserable time. So
        much easier with bill withers voice just the two of us. I need to get a tent. I should buy myself some clothes too.
        Who am I dressing for nevermind. Where's it going? This hoa is a scam I know I know that's mostly my fault. Well
        entirely so I guess. I could've not bought a place here. Hindsight. I got some good chores done. Sticker test was
        a minor success. Can I print full edge to edge? I think I need a cooler setup for that. Maybe some settings to
        dial in. Backburner idea to have in the pocket. I guess I could just cheat the numbers. At least on my end for
        funsies. Oh ya. $0.000076365215 per stream. I'm on track to bring in ~$1 per song per month. If I try hard. I need
        spotify premium to get into anakin mode though. Another interesting backburner idea maybe. Alright time to dive into
        the day. Thanks for your time.

        I said I should blog about it. That'll be in a little bit. Maybe I should start all of these with a loosely connected
        quote. Do me a favor and listen to as the world turns by blackalicious. I think the funniest answer to "how does

        and <a href="https://benny1548132.neocities.org/">benny</a> for some fuel today. Holy the sun beaming
        and bright. Cursing y'all with links. If your sites ever go down I'm going to look stupid! I think I like rambling
        here because I never <i>actually</i> learned how to hold a pen/cil properly. It gets very uncomfortable. There's a lot of
        lore in my head. Maybe it'll make sense. This is the only medium I can exist. Ya know? I somehow made the best
        cup of coffee I've had in a <b>while</b>. I should measure things. I'd always have a great cup of coffee. But I don't.
        I like to eyeball it "feels right". I saw two bucks this morning. They were just hanging out. Squared up for a second
        and just stared but nothing happened. I also <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> and

        Nice excuse to get outside during work hours though. I ran out of yogurt. Peach noosa is very good. The first time
        I had grits I thought it was just weird looking oatmeal and I added a bunch of brown sugar. The slack online
        indicator makes no sense to me. Gunpla mood but I don't have any on deck. I love my lil robot dollies. Still haven't
        watched any of the series I'm a fake fan. Everything passed the hardware check! I still could fix one of my mixers
        buuut I have (convoluted) workarounds. I could show that off. Maybe just use one of the gifs? Once I nail the full
        workflow it'll feel less intimidating. Like anything. My eventual goal is 100 minute beat tape with 100 minutes of
        video to go with it. I'll put it on tape, cd, vhs and give them to my friends. That way they have no convenient
        way to actually watch and listen to it. Get it? You've had like 40 years to get a vcr guys come on. It's a bit like

        If you want to look thinner, hang around people fatter than you. I can't not complain about mondays man. I'm still
        not used to getting my sprits crushed by the weight of being an adult in a failing* society. Lasagna vibes. The
        instant transition from relaxing to work mode is pretty nutty. There should be a warmup day to start the week.
        Is that what sundays are supposed to be? That's sad. Maybe I need to work harder to work less on the weekends.
        Isn't that a crazy concept. I'm not <i>really</i> complaining by the way. My job is pretty neat all things considered.
        What is it with human beings we're never satisfied. I don't <i>get it</i> get it, but based on how I feel I can
        see how billionaires become literal fucking dragons. Like they objectively do <b>not</b> have real problems, but
        everyone has problems. Ya know? And that's not in defense or anything. There's no real right way to be living. Don't
        know. I'm coming across as some bootlicking loser. All I mean is that... buckle up, problems are problems. Maybe it's
        better to say feelings are feelings. Problems can get kinda objective in a subjective way. Depends on which brain is analyzing what.
        Maybe? The bummer for me this morning is hr and it stuff. Training on the calendar. What training? We all ask.
        <b>WE</b> we. Not <i>we</i> we. Haha you said weewee. Whose side am I on? Did I even make the team? Am I just the
        waterboy? Probably just the weird dude watching the game with no kids. I don't think I'm craving a participation
        trophy. I don't mind sharing a jersey with the benchwarmers. I just want to be in the pic at the end of the season.
        I think? I just got dropped off can your mom take me home? I'm a spoiled only child. I want instant gratification
        and lots of it. Fuck. I took all y'alls energy for that spirit bomb yesterday. Good energy <b>WILL</b> be returned!
        I keep (a few of) my promises. Honest**. I started today in a bad mood. For no hypocritical time based reasons at all.
        That was a long circle anyways I have a stacked day it seems. New month brings new energy. I might get a new mug.
        That'd be sick. My mind was too focused on the weekend. As much as I've complained this work week is going to be
        a nice refresh from the weekend. I just need to take a vacation sheesh. Why are checklists so hard? I'm too flowy.
        I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">can't</span> don't write things down before the fact. I guess I could
        write things down after. Like an accomplishment list instead of a todo list. Motivation is weird. I feel unmotivated
        but stuff still happens so like? #winning? I'm trying too hard but not enough. I get stuff done but what is all this?
        But then putting all this (lol goodness) towards my career means... more money? I don't know. My bills are thankfully
        paid for now. For now. How ominous. Maybe that's why I feel this way. Anyways I don't know hanging out isn't an
        option. Gas station coffee this morning. Pretty mid. Especially now that it's cold. Batman doesn't care about mondays.
        It's just another day. Let's get this bread. Let's do this. I'm alive awake alert enthusiastic. He stares blankly
        illuminated by four screens. Ten computers is nutty dude. Meeting time. Thanks, Shia and thanks for your time.

        Yesterday was a rest day alright? Happy to see that the stats refreshed as expected for the new month. No debugging!
        Feels good. No one is using the little like buttons. I guess that makes sense. Just rambling about nothing here.
        If I hear about daylight savings in the office I'm going to lose it. I mean not actually at all. Just so funny how
        the exact script gets hit twice a year. Gotta bond over what you can in the office I guess? Gf baking
        continues. Man, it all SUCKS. Pastries and baked goods were definitely taken for granted. I'd do too much for a walmart
        blueberry muffin. Some garlic bread? Biscuits and gravy?? Sheeeesh what kind of loser <i>becomes</i> allergic to
        gluten. It's the chemtrails or the fluoride or whatever. It's a beautiful day outside. Makes me
        a bit nervous. A mountain november shouldn't hit 80s probably. I'm not meteorologist though. Those atoc classes
        in college were pretty neat. Maybe in another life. Maybe later in this one. It seems to be an exceptionally
        difficult time to plan for the future. I was already a bit bummed flowing with the status quo. What even is that
        nowadays? There will most certainly be <i>a</i> future. Duh. Just completely flipped. Who knows how much planning
        now will even help? I guess that's been the vibe since forever in some ways. Maybe? So is tiktok going away for real
        real? I thought it already would have happened. It definitely shouldn't be sold and censored blah blah blah I'll
        be so happy when it's gone. I have enough...conviction? determination? to not get sucked into whatever the us version
        looks like. Just can't keep the original deleted off my phone for more than a week. Maybe I don't have the conviction
        then. We'll have to see. I say all that to say I hate how much doom scrolling I do. It's not even worth it like 99%
        of the time. Super addicting. Am I really that bummed to miss out on the dumb shit my friends send me? I'm bad at
        being bored. My mind has been deep fried. Well-done. A general detox might be in the books. Just less social media
        shit. Less mindless gaming. The zombies mode on rivals has sucked up an embarrassing amount of time for me. Why
        do I even play that game at all? Pve was a nice change of pace. Far from being generally sucked back in. Even against
        bots those guys are absolutely miserable. Such a crazy concept. I guess mindlessly playing as a substitute for
        tiktok is far from a better vibe. I have a secret just for y'all. I ate so many mcnuggets. My stomach has been
        killing me. Not worth it. I always assume any gluten will be. Never is. Crazy I didn't become a crazy
        drug addict with that mindset. 청개구리. Don't do that == it <i>has</i> to be good. I actually did my morning
        stretches today. Feels good. I need to get more active. Not in a body dysmorphia way. I'm so gd out of shape.
        It's getting to cringe levels I'm sure. Halloween destroyed any illusion I had about being healthy. I watched so
        many movies and ate SO much candy. Not a single trick-or-treater. Pretty expected honestly but I always
        stay stocked just in case. Oh well no one came to claim this candy guess I have to eat it alllll myself! Such a shame.
        It can't be going to waste now right? At least I'm not at candy for breakfast levels. That's such a low bar. I mean,
        sometimes it really do be that low. Lunch plans today. No exclamation point. Summoning a spirit bomb. Good energy
        will be repaid I promise. Thanks for your time.

        Cooking bacon is so satisfying. Breakfast food is peak food. I wonder if I'll ever get confronted. I'm afraid
        someone could see all this and take any of it seriously. Just a gentle reminder: This is not sponsored content,
        there is no business, I accept no funding or donations. I just like making stuff. I just dropped an egg on the
        floor for the first time in my life. That's crazy. Anyways, I was saying I'm afraid someone sees any of this and
        <i>believes</i> it. Or they believe that I believe it. I'm just doodling here guys. Just awful at drawing. I wouldn't
        call this unique or original ya know? It's just all funsies. There's a lot goin on out there. Just wanted a clear
        little post. Don't believe anything online. Certainly nothing here. Thanks for your time.

        You all <i>really</i> had me going there for a second. I'm a bit impressed. Maybe a bit more ashamed. How did I
        not see it right from the start? I appreciate the appreciation but you're not real! I can see the numbers ya know.
        Not the built-in numbers. The leaky ones. The <i>real</i> 1s. Honestly, and luckily for me, this is all just larp.
        A cosplay. A mask. A fugazi, you know what a fugazi is? The real honest truth is there's nothing here for <b>you</b>.
        That'll be a trip to reread in the future. Who am I talking to? Who do I do this for? Like for REALLY real. I guess
        I just assumed (maybe hoped?) no one read these. I <i>do</i> pull a whole bait and switch to make the screenshots
        appealing. So I suppose I hoped someone <i>saw</i> this. But to read it? I suppose I'm confused what's to see.
        Just an old, tired goblin ranting to the void. Am I some jester? A zoo animal? "Let's go check on b, it's been a
        while." Is this fun? Does this interest you? Really it doesn't actually matter. The idea of constantly performing
        drives me crazy. Because the <b>honest</b> honest answer is, I do love it. Read my stupid thoughts. I love it.
        Tell me I'm interesting. I love it. Tell me you find interest in the absolute mundane shit I talk about. I love it.
        Tell me I'm smart and have cool thoughts and make good art. I need it. Is that good? I have goosebumps that felt
        pretty fuckin edgy. Again, a performance. Just lying for funsies. Trying to craft mental images of myself. For
        the bit. Did you believe it? Even for just a second? As much as I appreciate y'all stopping by, it's killing me.
        And it's my fault. Like look at what I just wrote, and what's below. These aren't my thoughts. Maybe that's the
        best practice. Thanks, Shia. All that said, it's a form of my thoughts so maybe not even a big deal. Just turns
        out the void is a bit more populated than I thought. Which is a beautiful thing. What a brisk mountain morning.
        My ears hurt but just a little bit. The sun is beaming though. Another beautiful thing. Did I already talk about
        dogs here? What a crazy concept. I can't believe this guy. I did make that lame joke but if you're here I hope
        you can at least find it a bit entertaining at times. Just an "old" man rambling. Which is pretentious as fuck.
        Maybe once I can officially drop the quotes it would be interesting. I'm just <i>a</i> guy rambling. Who cares?
        That's been the fun of it for me though. Doing it anyways. That'd be super inspirational if I had cooler hobbies.
        But I'm not here to inspire. It's too baked in at this point. "Why do you do xyz?" I need a productive answer.
        Because I can is too weak. Because I want(ed) to is even weaker. Gotta justify with roi and growth and long term
        viability. "Why do you surround yourself with people like that?" THEY surrounded ME. Ya know? Meme cosplay
        cringelord mask aside, I can't help but be more conversational. Way less into the void and more to <b>you</b>.
        Again, will be funny if I ever reread. I watch my own videos and listen to my own music. I suppose that's meant
        to be consumable. Even if it's purely "for me". I don't see this as "real" content. Like the scraps of a process?
        Not sure. I'd probably "get just as far" with uploading chunks of lorem ipsum. What even is this what even are we?
        Yo I've been churning out gifs. So much nicer than any full video. Shorter, crunchy == good, no audio to sync.
        Been having so much fun. A real mix of tools there too so always good practice. I've lost all my touchdesigner
        steeze though. Goodness. That's an app I need to practice. I wonder what any sort of pro in these tools thinks.
        Like how amateur is all of this <i>really</i>? It's been fun so I can't say that I care but I'm curious. As if
        there's some objective rank I could get and level up. Good lord, need to cool it on the isekais. I'm straight up
        not even reading/watching any at the moment. It's those stupid late night ai recap videos. The boy's name is Jack.
        Ya I watch that slop so what? I'll go eat mcdonalds too. The issue with all that memeing is that this is a long
        one. I've been making gifs, finally made a lil button for the neocities randys, my last 3d print project finally
        worked out. Too many low level engineering skill checks I completely failed. Stats are looking rough for this month.
        Hopefully the rollover works. I just need to actually log things better. I am not very flexible though. Maybe I
        should cool it on the nerd vibes. This can't be healthy for me. It's those dang phones. This one's a straight filler
        good lord nothing of value. But to <b>you</b>, thanks for your time.

        "Why did I ever stop drinking?" is a popular question whenever I have a drink. Funny question to be asking. And DANG
        do I feel great right now. That being said, it's all in an effort to fight the sunday scaries. Mondays maaan. Lasagna
        vibes. Do office drones <i>actually</i> care about their work? It's hard to imagine for me sometimes. Too much red
        tape, politics, and stupid meetings. Oh maaan the meetings! I could go on a tangent talking about nepotism and
        the wrong people for the wrong jobs but I'm tired and no one listens. As if I have anything insightful or original
        to add there. The earth still spins. The tracker has been working pretty flawlessly since implementation. Big surprise
        to me to be quite honest. I guess there was a bunch of work and debugging before launch. Excited to have less maintenance.
        Slightly related, the media server has been chugging along like a dream. I need to automate updates and reboots
        at some point. An ssh, up, enter, is pretty small brain though. This week (these weeks) have been pretty boring.
        Creative drought. Nothing being worked on at the moment. Games have been taking up too much of my time. Yotei dropped
        so I of course had to no life that. BF6 has been refreshing and I haven't touched rivals since. I picked up megabonk
        yesterday and already have 20 hours. At some point I'll play the new pokemon. Ya ya I know, but I was literally
        raised on that. I only beat violet once. Haven't really played it on the switch2 other than a quick scouting mission
        when I got it. There's the whole dlc sections that are totally new to me. Back burner stuff though. Project wise
        I guess I'm back in 3d printing land. Got some simple organization made which makes things a little cleaner. Throwaway
        light idea too. Right now the project is a magnetic toolbox organizer. My main issue there is I'm a massive moron
        and can't measure. Easy enough fixes though. I'm halfway there in terms of features though. I'll probably end up
        fixing all those while avoiding my day job. Stocks still stocking. I am once again complaining about $rxrx. I don't
        even really know why I'm still there. I'm getting destroyed elsewhere. Being kept alive with dividends. Small potatoes
        but still in the black for now. I'll keep the finance talk at that before I drive myself insane talking about
        current events. That's all I have now. This soju keeps calling to me. If any of the randy new followers see this
        in the void; Thanks for your time.

        <h1>An Untimely Meditation on Backend Changes</h1>
        <h5><span class="b">9, 27, 2025</span><span class="normal"> - </span><span class="b">10, 7, 2025</span></h5>

        So many backend changes. No one would appreciate it unless I yap about it! Check it. The first thing y'all (as if
        anyone reads these) will notice is the nice new colors. Huge palette swap literally just to account for a dithering
        preset I use for all my images. Overkill for sure but look at that consistency. The main reason for a palette swap
        was to add some hue distance. Mostly seen on the main site /art page. Anyways, after that decided to just plug into
        my main site for files and such. Small lift I should've done from the start. Definitely necessary. Keeps my individual
        load on the neocities servers a bit lighter. On this side of the house there's a new /stats page. Conceptually
        another straight rip from <a href="http://princss.online/microblog">princss.online</a>, an absolute genius at
        personal site vibe. The microblog aspect is just status.cafe. The habit tracking, I imagine, is way more convoluted
        on my end though. The stats shown are from my phone. I personally use and like chronicling. Snappy with nice widgets.
        Anyways, I <i>think</i> (really hope tbh) that there aren't public apis or anything like that to nicely export my data.
        Luckily the app itself exports a .csv. I'm taking that .csv and throwing the contents into a formatted txt file,
        pushing that to github through a cloudflare worker, then pulling the info back down here where I do a little formatting.
        Why? I have NO idea how to use ios shortcuts. That and I want to keep this repo private. It's pretty cringe.
        But yea, a whole web of spaghetti just for automatic habit tracking. I'm hoping the public shame of missing too many
        events will motivate me some (as if anyone reads these). The small pain point from all this was dealing with
        screenjesus. I think he's permissioned to see the stats, but I have no idea what the neocities "cooldown" period is
        and I haven't seen a successful screenshot yet. I point these updates to the junkdrawer on my main site. Bait and switch!
        It's definitely a lot cooler than walls of text every update. Oh yea, back to the main site though. I did a bunch
        of component-ing and slimmed the project down quite a bit. Fewer files in general. I'm generating all my art
        pages instead of making new ones for each entry. Can you believe I work in tech? I guess that's the bit of fun in
        the personal side of writing code. It can be as clean or messy as you want. And no jira tickets! It was a massive pain
        to go through though. Something to be said about proper planning. To be fair, that's just what happens with an
        evolving site. Neat that I can do this all myself too. New book added, but that technically happened last update.
        That's all I got for y'all this round. Thanks for your time.

        Making moves! I'm not a flashy guy, all behind the scenes. There are some new items in the ephemera collection and
        ALL the dithered images are new. I honestly don't think anyone will notice. But it was a good practice in organization
        as well. I'm listening to music this evening. This will either be a short entry or take forever to write. What a
        week. The new skate has been very fun. I need to plug in and checkout the hardware. Maybe some specific content for
        that? I hit that streak of blender renders but taking a break. I want to upgrade my rig(s). A new phone's been
        calling my name though. I really should be spending LESS time there though. Do I really need to watch tiktoks for
        longer? My battery charger has already paid for itself. Maybe I just need to play music constantly. I'm not
        ready to fly off the handle on some dumb shit. I'm probably just tired as well. I usually ramble a bit first thing
        in the morning. This is really all just a test to see if the bot thing works. Let's just keep it simple at that.

        Where to start? Many thoughts have been rattling around for many days. I should get better at updating this regularly. If anything for my own practice in
        journaling. I guess I'll start with a useless plea into the void. For the love of christ do NOT scan your government
        id or face into any of these apps or websites. I already made the lame joke on my profile; but I can't believe just
        because thiel wants to play irl mr house we have to expose ourselves to insane privacy concerns just to jack off.

        uploaded. Maybe I should? Maybe I will? I'm feeling a heavy blanket of constant anxiety with the state of the
        world I guess. I thought things would be easy. Or maybe just not this hard. Again, hate to be all "erhm we're
        literally living in idiocracy rn" but the white house rose garden got paved over and there are talks of hosting
        a goddamn wwe match there? Like what the hell? Military's 250th anniversary march <i>sponsored by the fucking
        ufc</i>? Maaan. Like that's objectively crazy right? I guess I really don't understand the right wing push the
        world seems to be making. Are rich people <i>that</i> goddamn rich? Like a <i>synchronized, global</i> effort?
        Hopefully I'm just a crazy nut job and everything's just kind of stupid right now. I guess I don't see the appeal
        otherwise, to right wing politics. Without of course a firehose of disinformation being shoved down your throat.
        I can see how single issue voters "have" to pick a side. That still seems flimsy as shit. My thought loops always
        come to a very unsatisfying "rich people are fucking insane". God. As an individual I've been working more on animation.
        Churned out a bunch of neat little art projects since the last update. I need to get all my code and scripts organized
        and in a presentable state. I've been spreading my videos and pictures a bit more. Marketing is never fun. I can't
        even pretend I'm doing that, just posting in more places. We'll see if I can continue posting on youtube here soon.
        Oh ya. A lot of my health problems recently may just be celiac disease. Yay on figuring that out. Boo on figuring
        that out. Ignorance is bliss. I mean I was still "suffering" but at least I was eating pasta and cake. So far I've
        struggled for good replacement recipes for everything. I'm anti-"replace everything with a gluten-free version".
        Like gf pasta blows. I'd rather have a meal inherently be gf. Does that make any sense? That's a weird thing I judge
        the veg people for. Like stop trying to make a burger replica, just eat good veg food. There's plenty of it.
        I wonder how many of these unhinged thoughts my mother has had. I wonder if my mother has had any of the same
        unhinged thoughts as me. That sounds a bit better. I'm bumping some music, dinner was good, maybe things are
        going to end up alright. Is it selfish to append a "for me" to that? I'm going to go ahead and just wrap this up.
        I'm sure the nsa is already in my pc scanning each and every bit. Thanks for your time.

      Ayo! It's been a bit I suppose. Toys acquired! New (to me) PC has arrived and is set up. My old paper printer
    died RIGHT when I got a new sketchbook. I had a bit of a spill with some ink and wanted to cover up some splotches.
    Mosey on over to the printer, "no print head detected". Disgusting. What do you MEAN? I love how it's been able to
    connect to the botnet and update itself LOUDLY at 3am. When it comes to getting use? No way. I couldn't even
    bypass the alert thing to access the scanner. DISGUSTING. I tried to pry it apart and put it back together with
    no luck. It would've been smart to try and figure out a use for it, but I'm already a bit of a hoarder. Anyways,
    it's been replaced. Have a nice toner printer now. Praying that solves the ink drinking problem. My first prints
    have already been clean and DRY. Not just absolutely sopping wet. I worked too slow on my buddy's site. His
    old one is down. Now I have to pry the info from him instead of copying text. Good problems to have in the grand
    scheme of things I guess. This is meant to be more diary-y, but I still want to avoid <i>certain</i> topics.
    I mean, things are pretty crazy to say the absolute least. Trying to carve out more of an escape I guess here.
    Even if it is stream of consciousness-y. I guess it can't be <i>that</i> stream of consciousness-y if I put
    everything through a filter beforehand. Brains man, so weird. Project wise, things have been quiet honestly.
    I did a little mixed media collage thing to break in the sketchbook and printer, have a couple of ideas baking
    but have yet to really dive in. No excuses there really. I re-re-restarted ghosts of tsushima recently. That's
    definitely been a time sink. Just lame adult personal "projects" really. Need to get into the COOL stuff.
    I can really feel its impacts on my mental health. I've been brainrotting with so much youtube and tiktok recently.
    Good lord. It can't be healthy to have access to that much content. I do just watch a lot of dumb stuff but I
    wonder how much it's all <i>really</i> formulated. I already know it's addicting but... Also, at a certain point
    you just sound conspiratorial. Or like a health nut. Ya know? Maybe? The rain has been nutty. The other day
    the dog and I got pelted by hail. He's been in plenty of snow and rain, but I guess not hail. Not that size at least.
    I think he liked it. Ice cubes are one of his favorite treats. Can you imagine like cupcakes falling out of the sky?
    Maybe some warm apple turnovers. Damn. I don't have cloudy with a chance of meatballs lore handy so the
    logistics of trying to catch a warm falling apple turnover without it hitting the ground is kind of funny.
    Is that what the movies are? I never liked the concept of the giant omelette from neopets. You'd always be
    getting a piece off the ground. This was definitely dumber than most, but I wanted to make up for the delay
    I guess. Must stay consistent in shouting into the void. Thanks for your time.

      My demon dog poked holes in my new yoga mat without hesitation. Adds character? I wrote a nice script
    that helps me write these blog updates. <a href=https://files.catbox.moe/qnuz5x.mp4>Check out a quick demo</a>.
    The weather has been beautiful. Windows have been open and the dog and I have been getting our steps in.
    Allergies still absolutely destroying me. Typing these in nvim is a bit weird. It keeps suggesting commands
    and words I've previously typed. Kinda just typing and rambling to fill this entry out. Mostly workflow testing.
    I got a new blanket that's nice and cozy. Actually the exact same pattern as my last one. Why are waffle irons so
    hard to clean. Those lil peg things are insane. I'm writing in nvim and I'm using 25% of my RAM? Seems a bit high.
    I might bake some cookies tonight. Nice treat after a lame work day. A little couch tray would be nice. Balance some drinks.
    I need to work on a new new animation. I should start learning to model for real. Never was my main goal. I don't know maaaaan.
    Sandwiches have been slappin recently. Damn I should've made some pickled peppers. This is mostly just a test I think I'll just cut
    it here. Thanks for your time.

      It is done. Finally got around to a full linux rice. Really just expanding the design language of the website to hardware.
    I think it's neat. This is my first "real" edit in neovim too. Liking it so far. We'll see how smooth a git push goes.
    I guess I still need to do an edit on neofetch but that's not a very high priority. I got a custom power menu, the app
    menu looks good, I got my lockscreen dope, what else? I got a neat <nobr>date/time</nobr> entry on polybar.
    The whole shebang. Allergies are KILLING me. Anyways, I have it up and running as a daily runner. NEAT. I'm sure that I'm missing
    some more tools but time will tell. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I'm unsure about the audio quality</span> SIKE! Figured that out pretty easily.
    Just some driver stuff and a slight edit to an EQ app. It'll probably be a bit of that off and on for a while. It's getting late
    and I should get up early to hit the grocery store. I'll keep this one short a sweet. Thanks for your time.

      <nobr>F O U R</nobr> new dumb animations just went live. They've existed online for a while at this point.
    It's real now that it's all linked and posted on <i>my</i> site though. I think it would be cool to have a microblog
    section. I <i>really</i> like how <a href="http://princss.online/microblog">princss.online</a> has theirs setup.
    Huge fan of the ratios and stacking. Cannot overstate how much I love all the dithering too. Such a cool lil
    aesthetic choice. Noticing it get "kinda big". Hard to really tell though with how insane the tiktok algorithm gets.
    Oh ya, I say it's getting big because every other video I see is some dithering technique. Nerds stay ahead of the curve B).
    That weekend I was dreading last post came and went without a hitch. Lmfao. Who could've guessed a fairly average
    day would go alright. A bit of weirdness afoot this week. Not entirely sure how to feel about it all. I think
    overthinking could just cause more of a headache. I still need to clean my printer. No idea why nothing's sticking.
    Beyond annoying having to nuke so many prints. I keep procrastinating. I took most of this week off. Beyond necessary
    for my mental health. Crazy how staying sane is now so much of my time (not being dramatic at all). One of my friends
    is getting into linux ricing which is just absolutely amazing. Was starting to doubt anyone irl even thought about
    that shit. Can't wait to see what gets whipped up. No idea what the next animation will be. Maybe a digital collage thing?
    I have a bunch of themed images lined up. Blender? Hardly knew her! The "spaces" have been fun to build and play with.
    I need to get blosm up and running again. I think I got rid of my token. Maybe the elevations were off? Still not
    100% on what's up there. I'd love a nap right now sheesh. 2pm hits like a train. Let's get a little workout in
    and see how things feel from there. Don't even ask me about my reading progress please. A library archive might be fun?
    Seems a shame to just swap out the 3d model spinning everytime. Yo, ok. Imagine maybe a digital bookshelf, and on click
    the model pops up with a review? That could look cool. Am I smart enough to give a review? I guess I'll keep it
    away from critiquing. JUST a "did I like it" type review. Just spitballing. A lot of questions here and in other places.
    What does it mean? Thanks for your time.

      First web gig. Nothing mindblowing, just being asked to make a personal site for someone. Paid this time. Very
    little of anything I think is badass and cool. It <i>is</i> for someone else and I still have no clout. Work is
    driving me insane. I wonder if I'll make it to retirement before going absolute postal (giving 2 weeks) and
    storming out. Maybe there will be a whole personal site resurgence and I'll be able to pay the bills as a freelancer.
    Probably not. I'm re-re-re-re-rendering my last animation. Touchdesigner chromakeying isn't as nice as I want it
    to be. Maybe there's more fiddling to do. I couldn't find a sweet spot yet with my animation. It almost works TOO
    well. Amazing what has green in it when you're trying to key it out. It's raining. In blender I just manually made
    some screens for the tv. I wanted a real green screen effect but it looked too bad. No more youtube views. Or
    music streams. Not surprising. A bit curious where the little pockets of streams come from though. There had to
    have been a popular song in europe that I was stealing shazzams from a few years ago. Words like 'few' and 'view'
    keep coming out as 'fewe' and 'viewe'. Ye olde neocities brain dump. I wonder if I'd be satisfied jacked into the
    mainframe. Just one of those brains in a jar plugged into a computer. Brooooooooo what if we're in the matrix
    right. now. maaaaaan. I still haven't won the lottery. Is there a way to manifest stronger manifestation powers?
    Last night was the first dnd session with the boys. Honestly? Surprised with how smoothly things ran. Looking
    forward to the next session. There's that one jrpg that came out. I already have a good enough backlog. Even limited
    to console. Some games just feel like couch games ya know? My pc is baking these renders pretty consistently anyways.
    I am dreading this saturday. Christ. I have a long weekend set for myself though. Why are so many work meetings
    <b>so</b> useless. It's a throwback to the first day of high school. Like when they just throw the freshman in to find
    their classes. Except I'm a salty, tired, very lame adult. "Let's go around the room and share a quote that
    inspires us!" I <i>know</i> it's just... team building or whatever. "I don't want to play the game" says the
    board piece. I guess I'm supposed to just start my own company and be my own boss right? Thanks for your time.

      Couple neat things got done I suppose. Finally got around to throwing together a homegrown guestbook. Seems a bit insane
    to me that there are so few applications out there. I constantly overestimate the number of personal site nerds.
    Neat to get it up though! I didn't want to run anything too crazy, just have some control over the css nawmean?
    Anyways, last animation went up in flames. Re-rendering 1k frames is always a blast. Got to learn a bit about
    the botnet render setup I was running, should be smoother sailing next time. I'm being bombarded by afterhour updates.
    Mostly people still trying to hype $rxrx. Personally just seems like a <i>bit</i> of a meme. What do I know though?
    I'm down 0.82% as of time of writing. That jesus and john wayne book is draining me. So boring and repetitive so far.
    It did help slightly guide a conversation with a good friend last night. Not a waste. Bunny day is finally done.
    I missed buying turnips this week though. I think I still have a stash of half a million bells, plenty of wiggle room.
    Final thoughts? I'm a bit hungry. I should eat breakfast earlier in the day. Pushing that off to send an update into the
    void is a bit silly. This isn't even <nobr>devlog/update</nobr> stuff. Pure morning stream of consciousness lmfao. Thanks for your time.

      Diary/devlog type page for y'all I guess? Just a way for me to keep thoughts a bit more seperated and focused.
    Want to leave room for pretentious rambling perhaps without making my full front-facing site too casual.
    Happy easter! I'm looking forward to bunny day being over. Everytime I'm in the mood for some nh that rabbit is
    <nobr>l u r k i n g.</nobr> I need to update my main site with a few more animations that finally finished. There's one more being rendered now.
    Probably best to wait a bit. I'm having a ton of fun learning blender and touchdesigner.
    Absolutely draining though to ask for every single view. At the end of the day, my "art" is far from polished OR unique, so I get it.
    I don't know maaan, it's less about the <nobr>views/recognition/path</nobr> to monetization. More that anyone who
    <i>might</i> fuck with it just isn't seeing it. Pray to the algorithms I suppose. I'm certainly not doing myself any favors with the
    atrocious seo that I have going on. What happened to doing it for the love of the game. I don't <i>want</i> to be a
    marketer. That type of thinking is pretty entitled though. Can't be asking for instant gratification with objectively uninteresting hobby work.
    /shrug gotta focus on the fun of it. The real ones get it. Looking forward to a nice week ahead. The sun's out in full force
    and my work calendar is clear enough. (I'm cutting it close with rambling here before a meeting) I figured out a smarter
    way to spit renders out so hopefully there's a site update soon. Thanks for your time.
