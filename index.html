        <h1>Post-Scarcity Utopianism and the Specter of Cocoa Nuts; Not Coconuts</h1>
        <h5>XI·VI·MMXXV - XI·XI·MMXXV</h5>
        ""Happy Veterans Day!"" Do y'all have today off? I hope these clouds roll through. I owe benny. I'm busy can't you
        see?! I think I don't like thinking. My calendar is a bit full today. One of these meetings interrupts my dog walk
        schedule. I'm going to add some pages to the main site. I want to have a section for my irl projects. I owe y'all
        working steal my stuff links. Haven't fully visualized that yet. I definitely need to just axe my instagram and link
        too. I don't really <i>get</i> it. I don't want to invest any time or additional information. Just in general
        I guess. I haven't been sleeping well. A lot of dreams recently. Out of the ordinary due to <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>.
        Very lame mundane ones though. What does that say about my mental state? Being asleep/dreaming is everything's
        natural state. Being awake was the weird mutation. Something something triple optics or like connected consciousness
        or whatever. I just want a steak. I actually did cook a few up for lunch yesterday. I hurt my shoulder. I slept
        wrong. I'm sleeping wrong and injuring myself. I'm getting hurt by being asleep incorrectly. Maybe if I stuck to
        my gd morning stretches I'd feel better! Crazy concept. I'm not good at working out sheeesh. Do I live too luxuriously?
        You need to hurt just a little bit. You don't have to but you need to ya know? Which is weird because like what is
        this all for? My last therapist told me to just breathe bro. Like what's that like? I wonder what I'm good at. Not
        what I think I'm good at, or truly believe I'm good at. What am I objectively factually good at? God there's the
        isekai rot seeping in "brooo what if like I had like a stat screen?" I swear I'm not watching any. I even stopped
        getting the tiktok summaries. Blah blah blah I think the important note out of this rambling today is: childish
        gambino acted like an asian teenager on tumblr. Something like that right? Why did bill gates go to the mom
        kardashian's birthday party? I finally beat nightmare 4 in rivals. Can finally uninstall again. No one told me it
        scales with the number of players ok? I figured it scaled a bit but not like that sheesh what a miserable time. So
        much easier with bill withers voice just the two of us. I need to get a tent. I should buy myself some clothes too.
        Who am I dressing for nevermind. Where's it going? This hoa is a scam I know I know that's mostly my fault. Well
        entirely so I guess. I could've not bought a place here. Hindsight. I got some good chores done. Sticker test was
        a minor success. Can I print full edge to edge? I think I need a cooler setup for that. Maybe some settings to
        dial in. Backburner idea to have in the pocket. I guess I could just cheat the numbers. At least on my end for
        funsies. Oh ya. $0.000076365215 per stream. I'm on track to bring in ~$1 per song per month. If I try hard. I need
        spotify premium to get into anakin mode though. Another interesting backburner idea maybe. Alright time to dive into
        the day. Thanks for your time.

        <h1>Problematizing the Category of Legible Blog Titles</h1>
        <h5>XI·IV·MMXXV - XI·V·MMXXV</h5>
        I said I should blog about it. That'll be in a little bit. Maybe I should start all of these with a loosely connected
        quote. Do me a favor and listen to as the world turns by blackalicious. I think the funniest answer to "how does
        xyz make you feel?" is "powerful". Anyways quick shoutout <a href="https://nohappynonsense.net/">nohappynonsense</a>
        and <a href="https://benny1548132.neocities.org/">benny</a> for some fuel today. Holy the sun beaming
        and bright. Cursing y'all with links. If your sites ever go down I'm going to look stupid! I think I like rambling
        here because I never <i>actually</i> learned how to hold a pen/cil properly. It gets very uncomfortable. There's a lot of
        lore in my head. Maybe it'll make sense. This is the only medium I can exist. Ya know? I somehow made the best
        cup of coffee I've had in a <b>while</b>. I should measure things. I'd always have a great cup of coffee. But I don't.
        I like to eyeball it "feels right". I saw two bucks this morning. They were just hanging out. Squared up for a second
        and just stared but nothing happened. I also <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> and
        have dinner tonight. Maybe exclamation point? Did y'all vote? Dear god tell me you voted! <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> and <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>. But that's <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>.
        Nice excuse to get outside during work hours though. I ran out of yogurt. Peach noosa is very good. The first time
        I had grits I thought it was just weird looking oatmeal and I added a bunch of brown sugar. The slack online
        indicator makes no sense to me. Gunpla mood but I don't have any on deck. I love my lil robot dollies. Still haven't
        watched any of the series I'm a fake fan. Everything passed the hardware check! I still could fix one of my mixers
        buuut I have (convoluted) workarounds. I could show that off. Maybe just use one of the gifs? Once I nail the full
        workflow it'll feel less intimidating. Like anything. My eventual goal is 100 minute beat tape with 100 minutes of
        video to go with it. I'll put it on tape, cd, vhs and give them to my friends. That way they have no convenient
        way to actually watch and listen to it. Get it? You've had like 40 years to get a vcr guys come on. It's a bit like
        the titles. What do you mean you can't read this hard to read font? Get it? One more shoutout to <a href="https://pirahxcx.neocities.org/">pirah</a>
        because I do the same thing. But ya there's a whole pepe silvia map in my head about the art and "art" that I make.
        It's funny and beautiful I swear will you settle down and have another cup of coffee? I got two certificates at
        work this year. It makes me feel... powerful. I have my banjo leaning and facing towards me. The reverb when I laugh
        and yell at my teammates (gaming, never at work) is fun. Do you have a single answer for "what would your superpower
        be?" I got some good work done yesterday. I want to hop back into blender. Man I need to hop back in touchdesigner
        too. Combo project next? Oh no I enjoy too many things. Let's finish this week strong. Damn I didn't even blog about
        the thing I said. Anyways disabling right click is lame. What secret sauce are you hiding from us? I want to be
        meaner. Do I get any points for refraining? It doesn't really matter anyways I just think we should all share and
        get along maaan. Spread the knowledge maaan. I was just curious anyways. Curiosity killed the cat. I hate mondays
        and love(d) lasagna sooo... Probably for the best. That's it. Meeting time! Let's get this. Let's stack that. Let's
        DO IT! Thanks for your time.

        <h1>From Antiquity to the Present: Thoughts on Cats Eating Italian Cuisine</h1>
        <h5>XI·III·MMXXV - XI·III·MMXXV</h5>
        If you want to look thinner, hang around people fatter than you. I can't not complain about mondays man. I'm still
        not used to getting my sprits crushed by the weight of being an adult in a failing* society. Lasagna vibes. The
        instant transition from relaxing to work mode is pretty nutty. There should be a warmup day to start the week.
        Is that what sundays are supposed to be? That's sad. Maybe I need to work harder to work less on the weekends.
        Isn't that a crazy concept. I'm not <i>really</i> complaining by the way. My job is pretty neat all things considered.
        What is it with human beings we're never satisfied. I don't <i>get it</i> get it, but based on how I feel I can
        see how billionaires become literal fucking dragons. Like they objectively do <b>not</b> have real problems, but
        everyone has problems. Ya know? And that's not in defense or anything. There's no real right way to be living. Don't
        know. I'm coming across as some bootlicking loser. All I mean is that... buckle up, problems are problems. Maybe it's
        better to say feelings are feelings. Problems can get kinda objective in a subjective way. Depends on which brain is analyzing what.
        Maybe? The bummer for me this morning is hr and it stuff. Training on the calendar. What training? We all ask.
        <b>WE</b> we. Not <i>we</i> we. Haha you said weewee. Whose side am I on? Did I even make the team? Am I just the
        waterboy? Probably just the weird dude watching the game with no kids. I don't think I'm craving a participation
        trophy. I don't mind sharing a jersey with the benchwarmers. I just want to be in the pic at the end of the season.
        I think? I just got dropped off can your mom take me home? I'm a spoiled only child. I want instant gratification
        and lots of it. Fuck. I took all y'alls energy for that spirit bomb yesterday. Good energy <b>WILL</b> be returned!
        I keep (a few of) my promises. Honest**. I started today in a bad mood. For no hypocritical time based reasons at all.
        That was a long circle anyways I have a stacked day it seems. New month brings new energy. I might get a new mug.
        That'd be sick. My mind was too focused on the weekend. As much as I've complained this work week is going to be
        a nice refresh from the weekend. I just need to take a vacation sheesh. Why are checklists so hard? I'm too flowy.
        I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">can't</span> don't write things down before the fact. I guess I could
        write things down after. Like an accomplishment list instead of a todo list. Motivation is weird. I feel unmotivated
        but stuff still happens so like? #winning? I'm trying too hard but not enough. I get stuff done but what is all this?
        But then putting all this (lol goodness) towards my career means... more money? I don't know. My bills are thankfully
        paid for now. For now. How ominous. Maybe that's why I feel this way. Anyways I don't know hanging out isn't an
        option. Gas station coffee this morning. Pretty mid. Especially now that it's cold. Batman doesn't care about mondays.
        It's just another day. Let's get this bread. Let's do this. I'm alive awake alert enthusiastic. He stares blankly
        illuminated by four screens. Ten computers is nutty dude. Meeting time. Thanks, Shia and thanks for your time.

        <h1>Towards a General Theory of Consistent Schedules</h1>
        <h5>X·XXX·MMXXV - XI·II·MMXXV</h5>
        Yesterday was a rest day alright? Happy to see that the stats refreshed as expected for the new month. No debugging!
        Feels good. No one is using the little like buttons. I guess that makes sense. Just rambling about nothing here.
        If I hear about daylight savings in the office I'm going to lose it. I mean not actually at all. Just so funny how
        the exact script gets hit twice a year. Gotta bond over what you can in the office I guess? Gf baking
        continues. Man, it all SUCKS. Pastries and baked goods were definitely taken for granted. I'd do too much for a walmart
        blueberry muffin. Some garlic bread? Biscuits and gravy?? Sheeeesh what kind of loser <i>becomes</i> allergic to
        gluten. It's the chemtrails or the fluoride or whatever. It's a beautiful day outside. Makes me
        a bit nervous. A mountain november shouldn't hit 80s probably. I'm not meteorologist though. Those atoc classes
        in college were pretty neat. Maybe in another life. Maybe later in this one. It seems to be an exceptionally
        difficult time to plan for the future. I was already a bit bummed flowing with the status quo. What even is that
        nowadays? There will most certainly be <i>a</i> future. Duh. Just completely flipped. Who knows how much planning
        now will even help? I guess that's been the vibe since forever in some ways. Maybe? So is tiktok going away for real
        real? I thought it already would have happened. It definitely shouldn't be sold and censored blah blah blah I'll
        be so happy when it's gone. I have enough...conviction? determination? to not get sucked into whatever the us version
        looks like. Just can't keep the original deleted off my phone for more than a week. Maybe I don't have the conviction
        then. We'll have to see. I say all that to say I hate how much doom scrolling I do. It's not even worth it like 99%
        of the time. Super addicting. Am I really that bummed to miss out on the dumb shit my friends send me? I'm bad at
        being bored. My mind has been deep fried. Well-done. A general detox might be in the books. Just less social media
        shit. Less mindless gaming. The zombies mode on rivals has sucked up an embarrassing amount of time for me. Why
        do I even play that game at all? Pve was a nice change of pace. Far from being generally sucked back in. Even against
        bots those guys are absolutely miserable. Such a crazy concept. I guess mindlessly playing as a substitute for
        tiktok is far from a better vibe. I have a secret just for y'all. I ate so many mcnuggets. My stomach has been
        killing me. Not worth it. I always assume any gluten will be. Never is. Crazy I didn't become a crazy
        drug addict with that mindset. 청개구리. Don't do that == it <i>has</i> to be good. I actually did my morning
        stretches today. Feels good. I need to get more active. Not in a body dysmorphia way. I'm so gd out of shape.
        It's getting to cringe levels I'm sure. Halloween destroyed any illusion I had about being healthy. I watched so
        many movies and ate SO much candy. Not a single trick-or-treater. Pretty expected honestly but I always
        stay stocked just in case. Oh well no one came to claim this candy guess I have to eat it alllll myself! Such a shame.
        It can't be going to waste now right? At least I'm not at candy for breakfast levels. That's such a low bar. I mean,
        sometimes it really do be that low. Lunch plans today. No exclamation point. Summoning a spirit bomb. Good energy
        will be repaid I promise. Thanks for your time.

        <h1>On the Practical Impossibility of Not Overthinking While Cooking Bacon</h1>
        <h5>X·XXIX·MMXXV - X·XXIX·MMXXV</h5>
        Cooking bacon is so satisfying. Breakfast food is peak food. I wonder if I'll ever get confronted. I'm afraid
        someone could see all this and take any of it seriously. Just a gentle reminder: This is not sponsored content,
        there is no business, I accept no funding or donations. I just like making stuff. I just dropped an egg on the
        floor for the first time in my life. That's crazy. Anyways, I was saying I'm afraid someone sees any of this and
        <i>believes</i> it. Or they believe that I believe it. I'm just doodling here guys. Just awful at drawing. I wouldn't
        call this unique or original ya know? It's just all funsies. There's a lot goin on out there. Just wanted a clear
        little post. Don't believe anything online. Certainly nothing here. Thanks for your time.

        <h1>The Semiotics of Being Named Truman</h1>
        <h5><span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> - X·XXIX·MMXXV</h5>
        You all <i>really</i> had me going there for a second. I'm a bit impressed. Maybe a bit more ashamed. How did I
        not see it right from the start? I appreciate the appreciation but you're not real! I can see the numbers ya know.
        Not the built-in numbers. The leaky ones. The <i>real</i> 1s. Honestly, and luckily for me, this is all just larp.
        A cosplay. A mask. A fugazi, you know what a fugazi is? The real honest truth is there's nothing here for <b>you</b>.
        That'll be a trip to reread in the future. Who am I talking to? Who do I do this for? Like for REALLY real. I guess
        I just assumed (maybe hoped?) no one read these. I <i>do</i> pull a whole bait and switch to make the screenshots
        appealing. So I suppose I hoped someone <i>saw</i> this. But to read it? I suppose I'm confused what's to see.
        Just an old, tired goblin ranting to the void. Am I some jester? A zoo animal? "Let's go check on b, it's been a
        while." Is this fun? Does this interest you? Really it doesn't actually matter. The idea of constantly performing
        drives me crazy. Because the <b>honest</b> honest answer is, I do love it. Read my stupid thoughts. I love it.
        Tell me I'm interesting. I love it. Tell me you find interest in the absolute mundane shit I talk about. I love it.
        Tell me I'm smart and have cool thoughts and make good art. I need it. Is that good? I have goosebumps that felt
        pretty fuckin edgy. Again, a performance. Just lying for funsies. Trying to craft mental images of myself. For
        the bit. Did you believe it? Even for just a second? As much as I appreciate y'all stopping by, it's killing me.
        And it's my fault. Like look at what I just wrote, and what's below. These aren't my thoughts. Maybe that's the
        best practice. Thanks, Shia. All that said, it's a form of my thoughts so maybe not even a big deal. Just turns
        out the void is a bit more populated than I thought. Which is a beautiful thing. What a brisk mountain morning.
        My ears hurt but just a little bit. The sun is beaming though. Another beautiful thing. Did I already talk about
        dogs here? What a crazy concept. I can't believe this guy. I did make that lame joke but if you're here I hope
        you can at least find it a bit entertaining at times. Just an "old" man rambling. Which is pretentious as fuck.
        Maybe once I can officially drop the quotes it would be interesting. I'm just <i>a</i> guy rambling. Who cares?
        That's been the fun of it for me though. Doing it anyways. That'd be super inspirational if I had cooler hobbies.
        But I'm not here to inspire. It's too baked in at this point. "Why do you do xyz?" I need a productive answer.
        Because I can is too weak. Because I want(ed) to is even weaker. Gotta justify with roi and growth and long term
        viability. "Why do you surround yourself with people like that?" THEY surrounded ME. Ya know? Meme cosplay
        cringelord mask aside, I can't help but be more conversational. Way less into the void and more to <b>you</b>.
        Again, will be funny if I ever reread. I watch my own videos and listen to my own music. I suppose that's meant
        to be consumable. Even if it's purely "for me". I don't see this as "real" content. Like the scraps of a process?
        Not sure. I'd probably "get just as far" with uploading chunks of lorem ipsum. What even is this what even are we?
        Yo I've been churning out gifs. So much nicer than any full video. Shorter, crunchy == good, no audio to sync.
        Been having so much fun. A real mix of tools there too so always good practice. I've lost all my touchdesigner
        steeze though. Goodness. That's an app I need to practice. I wonder what any sort of pro in these tools thinks.
        Like how amateur is all of this <i>really</i>? It's been fun so I can't say that I care but I'm curious. As if
        there's some objective rank I could get and level up. Good lord, need to cool it on the isekais. I'm straight up
        not even reading/watching any at the moment. It's those stupid late night ai recap videos. The boy's name is Jack.
        Ya I watch that slop so what? I'll go eat mcdonalds too. The issue with all that memeing is that this is a long
        one. I've been making gifs, finally made a lil button for the neocities randys, my last 3d print project finally
        worked out. Too many low level engineering skill checks I completely failed. Stats are looking rough for this month.
        Hopefully the rollover works. I just need to actually log things better. I am not very flexible though. Maybe I
        should cool it on the nerd vibes. This can't be healthy for me. It's those dang phones. This one's a straight filler
        good lord nothing of value. But to <b>you</b>, thanks for your time.

        I suppose. As if I yap about anything interesting here. Man. I wonder how it happened? Hopefully nothing fancy.
        The new guys seem off for sure though. How deep does it go!? Just some thoughts. I don't care that much. Leave me
        alone. I like going outside. I had a <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> which was amazing!
        Had the worst breakfast burrito and drink in my life too though.
        Real mixed bag today. Maybe <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>? Hard to say.

        <h1>The Cognitive Limits of an Old Man Drinking on a Sunday Evening</h1>
        <h5>X·VIII·MMXXV - X·XIX·MMXXV</h5>
        "Why did I ever stop drinking?" is a popular question whenever I have a drink. Funny question to be asking. And DANG
        do I feel great right now. That being said, it's all in an effort to fight the sunday scaries. Mondays maaan. Lasagna
        vibes. Do office drones <i>actually</i> care about their work? It's hard to imagine for me sometimes. Too much red
        tape, politics, and stupid meetings. Oh maaan the meetings! I could go on a tangent talking about nepotism and
        the wrong people for the wrong jobs but I'm tired and no one listens. As if I have anything insightful or original
        to add there. The earth still spins. The tracker has been working pretty flawlessly since implementation. Big surprise
        to me to be quite honest. I guess there was a bunch of work and debugging before launch. Excited to have less maintenance.
        Slightly related, the media server has been chugging along like a dream. I need to automate updates and reboots
        at some point. An ssh, up, enter, is pretty small brain though. This week (these weeks) have been pretty boring.
        Creative drought. Nothing being worked on at the moment. Games have been taking up too much of my time. Yotei dropped
        so I of course had to no life that. BF6 has been refreshing and I haven't touched rivals since. I picked up megabonk
        yesterday and already have 20 hours. At some point I'll play the new pokemon. Ya ya I know, but I was literally
        raised on that. I only beat violet once. Haven't really played it on the switch2 other than a quick scouting mission
        when I got it. There's the whole dlc sections that are totally new to me. Back burner stuff though. Project wise
        I guess I'm back in 3d printing land. Got some simple organization made which makes things a little cleaner. Throwaway
        light idea too. Right now the project is a magnetic toolbox organizer. My main issue there is I'm a massive moron
        and can't measure. Easy enough fixes though. I'm halfway there in terms of features though. I'll probably end up
        fixing all those while avoiding my day job. Stocks still stocking. I am once again complaining about $rxrx. I don't
        even really know why I'm still there. I'm getting destroyed elsewhere. Being kept alive with dividends. Small potatoes
        but still in the black for now. I'll keep the finance talk at that before I drive myself insane talking about
        current events. That's all I have now. This soju keeps calling to me. If any of the randy new followers see this
        in the void; Thanks for your time.

        <h1>An Untimely Meditation on Backend Changes</h1>
        <h5>IX·XXVII·MMXXV - X·VII·MMXXV</h5>
        So many backend changes. No one would appreciate it unless I yap about it! Check it. The first thing y'all (as if
        anyone reads these) will notice is the nice new colors. Huge palette swap literally just to account for a dithering
        preset I use for all my images. Overkill for sure but look at that consistency. The main reason for a palette swap
        was to add some hue distance. Mostly seen on the main site /art page. Anyways, after that decided to just plug into
        my main site for files and such. Small lift I should've done from the start. Definitely necessary. Keeps my individual
        load on the neocities servers a bit lighter. On this side of the house there's a new /stats page. Conceptually
        another straight rip from <a href="http://princss.online/microblog">princss.online</a>, an absolute genius at
        personal site vibe. The microblog aspect is just status.cafe. The habit tracking, I imagine, is way more convoluted
        on my end though. The stats shown are from my phone. I personally use and like chronicling. Snappy with nice widgets.
        Anyways, I <i>think</i> (really hope tbh) that there aren't public apis or anything like that to nicely export my data.
        Luckily the app itself exports a .csv. I'm taking that .csv and throwing the contents into a formatted txt file,
        pushing that to github through a cloudflare worker, then pulling the info back down here where I do a little formatting.
        Why? I have NO idea how to use ios shortcuts. That and I want to keep this repo private. It's pretty cringe.
        But yea, a whole web of spaghetti just for automatic habit tracking. I'm hoping the public shame of missing too many
        events will motivate me some (as if anyone reads these). The small pain point from all this was dealing with
        screenjesus. I think he's permissioned to see the stats, but I have no idea what the neocities "cooldown" period is
        and I haven't seen a successful screenshot yet. I point these updates to the junkdrawer on my main site. Bait and switch!
        It's definitely a lot cooler than walls of text every update. Oh yea, back to the main site though. I did a bunch
        of component-ing and slimmed the project down quite a bit. Fewer files in general. I'm generating all my art
        pages instead of making new ones for each entry. Can you believe I work in tech? I guess that's the bit of fun in
        the personal side of writing code. It can be as clean or messy as you want. And no jira tickets! It was a massive pain
        to go through though. Something to be said about proper planning. To be fair, that's just what happens with an
        evolving site. Neat that I can do this all myself too. New book added, but that technically happened last update.
        That's all I got for y'all this round. Thanks for your time.

        <h1>On the Practical Impossibility of Pursuing The Arts</h1>
        <h5>VIII·XIV·MMXXV - IX·XXVI·MMXXV</h5>
        Making moves! I'm not a flashy guy, all behind the scenes. There are some new items in the ephemera collection and
        ALL the dithered images are new. I honestly don't think anyone will notice. But it was a good practice in organization
        as well. I'm listening to music this evening. This will either be a short entry or take forever to write. What a
        week. The new skate has been very fun. I need to plug in and checkout the hardware. Maybe some specific content for
        that? I hit that streak of blender renders but taking a break. I want to upgrade my rig(s). A new phone's been
        calling my name though. I really should be spending LESS time there though. Do I really need to watch tiktoks for
        longer? My battery charger has already paid for itself. Maybe I just need to play music constantly. I'm not
        ready to fly off the handle on some dumb shit. I'm probably just tired as well. I usually ramble a bit first thing
        in the morning. This is really all just a test to see if the bot thing works. Let's just keep it simple at that.
        Thanks for your time.

        <h1>A Critical Reappraisal of the Sociohistorical Underpinnings of Not Being Able to Eat Gluten Anymore</h1>
        <h5>VI·XIX·MMXXV - VIII·XIII·MMXXV</h5>
        Fast-forward through the summer yeah? Never as fun as a single adult. Hope y'all got some nice sun. Good lord.
        Where to start? Many thoughts have been rattling around for many days. I should get better at updating this regularly. If anything for my own practice in
        journaling. I guess I'll start with a useless plea into the void. For the love of christ do NOT scan your government
        id or face into any of these apps or websites. I already made the lame joke on my profile; but I can't believe just
        because thiel wants to play irl mr house we have to expose ourselves to insane privacy concerns just to jack off.
        Hyperbole of course for now. Unless <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span> soon I can't image <i>not</i> having to deal with that. Double negatives
        get gross. Hopefully I'm just a conspiracy nut job spouting nonsense on his site. My fear as of now is that
        that fucking moron is going to actually carry through, make d.c. a "freedom city", hand it over to thiel...
        What happens next? I mean that's ignoring so much shit that's currently happening. RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES! I
        can't believe there's not <b>ONE</b> true patriot working in the government now. Maybe there are none considering
        <span class="censor-n" data-ch="5" aria-label="hidden"></span>. I guess I'm just here rambling to... no one? Future me? I don't read any of my writings once they get
        uploaded. Maybe I should? Maybe I will? I'm feeling a heavy blanket of constant anxiety with the state of the
        world I guess. I thought things would be easy. Or maybe just not this hard. Again, hate to be all "erhm we're
        literally living in idiocracy rn" but the white house rose garden got paved over and there are talks of hosting
        a goddamn wwe match there? Like what the hell? Military's 250th anniversary march <i>sponsored by the fucking
        ufc</i>? Maaan. Like that's objectively crazy right? I guess I really don't understand the right wing push the
        world seems to be making. Are rich people <i>that</i> goddamn rich? Like a <i>synchronized, global</i> effort?
        Hopefully I'm just a crazy nut job and everything's just kind of stupid right now. I guess I don't see the appeal
        otherwise, to right wing politics. Without of course a firehose of disinformation being shoved down your throat.
        I can see how single issue voters "have" to pick a side. That still seems flimsy as shit. My thought loops always
        come to a very unsatisfying "rich people are fucking insane". God. As an individual I've been working more on animation.
        Churned out a bunch of neat little art projects since the last update. I need to get all my code and scripts organized
        and in a presentable state. I've been spreading my videos and pictures a bit more. Marketing is never fun. I can't
        even pretend I'm doing that, just posting in more places. We'll see if I can continue posting on youtube here soon.
        Oh ya. A lot of my health problems recently may just be celiac disease. Yay on figuring that out. Boo on figuring
        that out. Ignorance is bliss. I mean I was still "suffering" but at least I was eating pasta and cake. So far I've
        struggled for good replacement recipes for everything. I'm anti-"replace everything with a gluten-free version".
        Like gf pasta blows. I'd rather have a meal inherently be gf. Does that make any sense? That's a weird thing I judge
        the veg people for. Like stop trying to make a burger replica, just eat good veg food. There's plenty of it.
        I wonder how many of these unhinged thoughts my mother has had. I wonder if my mother has had any of the same
        unhinged thoughts as me. That sounds a bit better. I'm bumping some music, dinner was good, maybe things are
        going to end up alright. Is it selfish to append a "for me" to that? I'm going to go ahead and just wrap this up.
        I'm sure the nsa is already in my pc scanning each and every bit. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>Inquiries into the Epistemological Ramifications of $5 Off Zyns</h1>
    <h5>V·XXII·MMXXV - VI·XVIII·MMXXV</h5>
    Ayo! It's been a bit I suppose. Toys acquired! New (to me) PC has arrived and is set up. My old paper printer
    died RIGHT when I got a new sketchbook. I had a bit of a spill with some ink and wanted to cover up some splotches.
    Mosey on over to the printer, "no print head detected". Disgusting. What do you MEAN? I love how it's been able to
    connect to the botnet and update itself LOUDLY at 3am. When it comes to getting use? No way. I couldn't even
    bypass the alert thing to access the scanner. DISGUSTING. I tried to pry it apart and put it back together with
    no luck. It would've been smart to try and figure out a use for it, but I'm already a bit of a hoarder. Anyways,
    it's been replaced. Have a nice toner printer now. Praying that solves the ink drinking problem. My first prints
    have already been clean and DRY. Not just absolutely sopping wet. I worked too slow on my buddy's site. His
    old one is down. Now I have to pry the info from him instead of copying text. Good problems to have in the grand
    scheme of things I guess. This is meant to be more diary-y, but I still want to avoid <i>certain</i> topics.
    I mean, things are pretty crazy to say the absolute least. Trying to carve out more of an escape I guess here.
    Even if it is stream of consciousness-y. I guess it can't be <i>that</i> stream of consciousness-y if I put
    everything through a filter beforehand. Brains man, so weird. Project wise, things have been quiet honestly.
    I did a little mixed media collage thing to break in the sketchbook and printer, have a couple of ideas baking
    but have yet to really dive in. No excuses there really. I re-re-restarted ghosts of tsushima recently. That's
    definitely been a time sink. Just lame adult personal "projects" really. Need to get into the COOL stuff.
    I can really feel its impacts on my mental health. I've been brainrotting with so much youtube and tiktok recently.
    Good lord. It can't be healthy to have access to that much content. I do just watch a lot of dumb stuff but I
    wonder how much it's all <i>really</i> formulated. I already know it's addicting but... Also, at a certain point
    you just sound conspiratorial. Or like a health nut. Ya know? Maybe? The rain has been nutty. The other day
    the dog and I got pelted by hail. He's been in plenty of snow and rain, but I guess not hail. Not that size at least.
    I think he liked it. Ice cubes are one of his favorite treats. Can you imagine like cupcakes falling out of the sky?
    Maybe some warm apple turnovers. Damn. I don't have cloudy with a chance of meatballs lore handy so the
    logistics of trying to catch a warm falling apple turnover without it hitting the ground is kind of funny.
    Is that what the movies are? I never liked the concept of the giant omelette from neopets. You'd always be
    getting a piece off the ground. This was definitely dumber than most, but I wanted to make up for the delay
    I guess. Must stay consistent in shouting into the void. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>An Exhaustive Treatise Upon the Origins, Development, and Present Condition of a Vegetable Soup with Meat</h1>
      <h5>V·XVIII·MMXXV - V·XXI·MMXXV</h5>
      My demon dog poked holes in my new yoga mat without hesitation. Adds character? I wrote a nice script
    that helps me write these blog updates. <a href=https://files.catbox.moe/qnuz5x.mp4>Check out a quick demo</a>.
    The weather has been beautiful. Windows have been open and the dog and I have been getting our steps in.
    Allergies still absolutely destroying me. Typing these in nvim is a bit weird. It keeps suggesting commands
    and words I've previously typed. Kinda just typing and rambling to fill this entry out. Mostly workflow testing.
    I got a new blanket that's nice and cozy. Actually the exact same pattern as my last one. Why are waffle irons so
    hard to clean. Those lil peg things are insane. I'm writing in nvim and I'm using 25% of my RAM? Seems a bit high.
    I might bake some cookies tonight. Nice treat after a lame work day. A little couch tray would be nice. Balance some drinks.
    I need to work on a new new animation. I should start learning to model for real. Never was my main goal. I don't know maaaaan.
    Sandwiches have been slappin recently. Damn I should've made some pickled peppers. This is mostly just a test I think I'll just cut
    it here. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>Towards a Theory on Custom Computer Stuff in the Modern World</h1>
    <h5>V·VIII·MMXXV - V·XVII·MMXXV</h5>
    It is done. Finally got around to a full linux rice. Really just expanding the design language of the website to hardware.
    I think it's neat. This is my first "real" edit in neovim too. Liking it so far. We'll see how smooth a git push goes.
    I guess I still need to do an edit on neofetch but that's not a very high priority. I got a custom power menu, the app
    menu looks good, I got my lockscreen dope, what else? I got a neat <nobr>date/time</nobr> entry on polybar.
    The whole shebang. Allergies are KILLING me. Anyways, I have it up and running as a daily runner. NEAT. I'm sure that I'm missing
    some more tools but time will tell. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I'm unsure about the audio quality</span> SIKE! Figured that out pretty easily.
    Just some driver stuff and a slight edit to an EQ app. It'll probably be a bit of that off and on for a while. It's getting late
    and I should get up early to hit the grocery store. I'll keep this one short a sweet. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>On the Topic of Ordering a $30 Sandwich</h1>
    <h5>IV·XXX·MMXXV - V·VII·MMXXV</h5>
    <nobr>F O U R</nobr> new dumb animations just went live. They've existed online for a while at this point.
    It's real now that it's all linked and posted on <i>my</i> site though. I think it would be cool to have a microblog
    section. I <i>really</i> like how <a href="http://princss.online/microblog">princss.online</a> has theirs setup.
    Huge fan of the ratios and stacking. Cannot overstate how much I love all the dithering too. Such a cool lil
    aesthetic choice. Noticing it get "kinda big". Hard to really tell though with how insane the tiktok algorithm gets.
    Oh ya, I say it's getting big because every other video I see is some dithering technique. Nerds stay ahead of the curve B).
    That weekend I was dreading last post came and went without a hitch. Lmfao. Who could've guessed a fairly average
    day would go alright. A bit of weirdness afoot this week. Not entirely sure how to feel about it all. I think
    overthinking could just cause more of a headache. I still need to clean my printer. No idea why nothing's sticking.
    Beyond annoying having to nuke so many prints. I keep procrastinating. I took most of this week off. Beyond necessary
    for my mental health. Crazy how staying sane is now so much of my time (not being dramatic at all). One of my friends
    is getting into linux ricing which is just absolutely amazing. Was starting to doubt anyone irl even thought about
    that shit. Can't wait to see what gets whipped up. No idea what the next animation will be. Maybe a digital collage thing?
    I have a bunch of themed images lined up. Blender? Hardly knew her! The "spaces" have been fun to build and play with.
    I need to get blosm up and running again. I think I got rid of my token. Maybe the elevations were off? Still not
    100% on what's up there. I'd love a nap right now sheesh. 2pm hits like a train. Let's get a little workout in
    and see how things feel from there. Don't even ask me about my reading progress please. A library archive might be fun?
    Seems a shame to just swap out the 3d model spinning everytime. Yo, ok. Imagine maybe a digital bookshelf, and on click
    the model pops up with a review? That could look cool. Am I smart enough to give a review? I guess I'll keep it
    away from critiquing. JUST a "did I like it" type review. Just spitballing. A lot of questions here and in other places.
    What does it mean? Thanks for your time.

    <h1>Concerning Chipotle Serving Sizes:</h1>
    <h5>IV·XXV·MMXXV - IV·XXIX·MMXXV</h5>
    First web gig. Nothing mindblowing, just being asked to make a personal site for someone. Paid this time. Very
    little of anything I think is badass and cool. It <i>is</i> for someone else and I still have no clout. Work is
    driving me insane. I wonder if I'll make it to retirement before going absolute postal (giving 2 weeks) and
    storming out. Maybe there will be a whole personal site resurgence and I'll be able to pay the bills as a freelancer.
    Probably not. I'm re-re-re-re-rendering my last animation. Touchdesigner chromakeying isn't as nice as I want it
    to be. Maybe there's more fiddling to do. I couldn't find a sweet spot yet with my animation. It almost works TOO
    well. Amazing what has green in it when you're trying to key it out. It's raining. In blender I just manually made
    some screens for the tv. I wanted a real green screen effect but it looked too bad. No more youtube views. Or
    music streams. Not surprising. A bit curious where the little pockets of streams come from though. There had to
    have been a popular song in europe that I was stealing shazzams from a few years ago. Words like 'few' and 'view'
    keep coming out as 'fewe' and 'viewe'. Ye olde neocities brain dump. I wonder if I'd be satisfied jacked into the
    mainframe. Just one of those brains in a jar plugged into a computer. Brooooooooo what if we're in the matrix
    right. now. maaaaaan. I still haven't won the lottery. Is there a way to manifest stronger manifestation powers?
    Last night was the first dnd session with the boys. Honestly? Surprised with how smoothly things ran. Looking
    forward to the next session. There's that one jrpg that came out. I already have a good enough backlog. Even limited
    to console. Some games just feel like couch games ya know? My pc is baking these renders pretty consistently anyways.
    I am dreading this saturday. Christ. I have a long weekend set for myself though. Why are so many work meetings
    <b>so</b> useless. It's a throwback to the first day of high school. Like when they just throw the freshman in to find
    their classes. Except I'm a salty, tired, very lame adult. "Let's go around the room and share a quote that
    inspires us!" I <i>know</i> it's just... team building or whatever. "I don't want to play the game" says the
    board piece. I guess I'm supposed to just start my own company and be my own boss right? Thanks for your time.

    <h1>A Couple Tweaks Here and There, A Tale</h1>
    <h5>IV·XXII·MMXXV - IV·XXIV·MMXXV</h5>
    Couple neat things got done I suppose. Finally got around to throwing together a homegrown guestbook. Seems a bit insane
    to me that there are so few applications out there. I constantly overestimate the number of personal site nerds.
    Neat to get it up though! I didn't want to run anything too crazy, just have some control over the css nawmean?
    Anyways, last animation went up in flames. Re-rendering 1k frames is always a blast. Got to learn a bit about
    the botnet render setup I was running, should be smoother sailing next time. I'm being bombarded by afterhour updates.
    Mostly people still trying to hype $rxrx. Personally just seems like a <i>bit</i> of a meme. What do I know though?
    I'm down 0.82% as of time of writing. That jesus and john wayne book is draining me. So boring and repetitive so far.
    It did help slightly guide a conversation with a good friend last night. Not a waste. Bunny day is finally done.
    I missed buying turnips this week though. I think I still have a stash of half a million bells, plenty of wiggle room.
    Final thoughts? I'm a bit hungry. I should eat breakfast earlier in the day. Pushing that off to send an update into the
    void is a bit silly. This isn't even <nobr>devlog/update</nobr> stuff. Pure morning stream of consciousness lmfao. Thanks for your time.

    <h1>First, Definitely a Stream of Consciousness</h1>
    <h5>IV·XX·MMXXV - IV·XXI·MMXXV</h5>
    Diary/devlog type page for y'all I guess? Just a way for me to keep thoughts a bit more seperated and focused.
    Want to leave room for pretentious rambling perhaps without making my full front-facing site too casual.
    Happy easter! I'm looking forward to bunny day being over. Everytime I'm in the mood for some nh that rabbit is
    <nobr>l u r k i n g.</nobr> I need to update my main site with a few more animations that finally finished. There's one more being rendered now.
    Probably best to wait a bit. I'm having a ton of fun learning blender and touchdesigner.
    Absolutely draining though to ask for every single view. At the end of the day, my "art" is far from polished OR unique, so I get it.
    I don't know maaan, it's less about the <nobr>views/recognition/path</nobr> to monetization. More that anyone who
    <i>might</i> fuck with it just isn't seeing it. Pray to the algorithms I suppose. I'm certainly not doing myself any favors with the
    atrocious seo that I have going on. What happened to doing it for the love of the game. I don't <i>want</i> to be a
    marketer. That type of thinking is pretty entitled though. Can't be asking for instant gratification with objectively uninteresting hobby work.
    /shrug gotta focus on the fun of it. The real ones get it. Looking forward to a nice week ahead. The sun's out in full force
    and my work calendar is clear enough. (I'm cutting it close with rambling here before a meeting) I figured out a smarter
    way to spit renders out so hopefully there's a site update soon. Thanks for your time.
