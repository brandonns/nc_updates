        <h5>IV·XXX·MMXXV - V·VII·MMXXV</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <nobr>F O U R</nobr> new dumb animations just went live. They've existed online for a while at this point.
        It's real now that it's all linked and posted on <i>my</i> site though. I think it would be cool to have a microblog
        section. I <i>really</i> like how <a href="http://princss.online/microblog">princess.online</a> has theirs setup.
        Huge fan of the ratios and stacking. Cannot overstate how much I love all the dithering too. Such a cool lil
        aesthetic choice. Noticing it get "kinda big". Hard to really tell though with how insane the tiktok algorithm gets.
        Oh ya, I say it's getting big because every other video I see is some dithering technique. Nerds stay ahead of the curve B).
        That weekend I was dreading last post came and went without a hitch. Lmfao. Who could've guessesd a fairly average
        day would go alright. A bit of weirdness afoot this week. Not entirely sure how to feel about it all. I think
        overthinking could just cause more of a headache. I still need to clean my printer. No idea why nothing's sticking.
        Beyond annoying having to nuke so many prints. I keep procrastinating. I took most of this week off. Beyond necessary
        for my mental health. Crazy how staying sane is now so much of my time (not being dramatic at all). One of my friends
        is getting into linux ricing which is just absolutely amazing. Was starting to doubt anyone irl even thought about
        that shit. Can't wait to see what gets whipped up. No idea what the next animation will be. Maybe a digital collage thing?
        I have a bunch of themed images lined up. Blender? Hardly knew her! The "spaces" have been fun to build and play with.
        I need to get blosm up and running again. I think I got rid of my token. Maybe the elevations were off? Still not
        100% on what's up there. I'd love a nap right now sheesh. 2PM hits like a train. Let's get a little workout in
        and see how things feel from there. Don't even ask me about my reading progress please. A library archive might be fun?
        Seems a shame to just swap out the 3d model spinning everytime. Yo, ok. Imagine maybe a digital bookshelf, and on click
        the model pops up with a review? That could look cool. Am I smart enough to give a review? I guess I'll keep it
        away from critiquing. JUST a "did I like it" type review. Just spitballing. A lot of questions here and in other places.
        What does it mean? Thanks for your time.

        <h5>IV·XXV·MMXXV - IV·XXIX·MMXXV</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        First web gig. Nothing mindblowing, just being asked to make a personal site for someone. Paid this time. Very
        little of anything I think is badass and cool. It <i>is</i> for someone else and I still have no clout. Work is
        driving me insane. I wonder if I'll make it to retirement before going absolute postal (giving 2 weeks) and
        storming out. Maybe there will be a whole personal site resurgence and I'll be able to pay the bills as a freelancer.
        Probably not. I'm re-re-re-re-rendering my last animation. Touchdesigner chromakeying isn't as nice as I want it
        to be. Maybe there's more fiddling to do. I couldn't find a sweet spot yet with my animation. It almost works TOO
        well. Amazing what has green in it when you're trying to key it out. It's raining. In blender I just manually made
        some screens for the tv. I wanted a real green screen effect but it looked too bad. No more youtube views. Or
        music streams. Not surprising. A bit curious where the little pockets of streams come from though. There had to
        have been a popular song in europe that I was stealing shazzams from a few years ago. Words like 'few' and 'view'
        keep coming out as 'fewe' and 'viewe'. Ye olde neocities brain dump. I wonder if I'd be satisfied jacked into the
        mainframe. Just one of those brains in a jar plugged into a computer. Brooooooooo what if we're in the matrix
        right. now. maaaaaan. I still haven't won the lottery. Is there a way to manifest stronger manifestation powers?
        Last night was the first dnd session with the boys. Honestly? Surprised with how smoothly things ran. Looking
        forward to the next session. There's that one jrpg that came out. I already have a good enough backlog. Even limited
        to console. Some games just feel like couch games ya know? My pc is baking these renders pretty consistently anyways.
        I am dreading this saturday. Christ. I have a long weekend set for myself though. Why are so many work meetings
        <b>so</b> useless. It's a throwback to the first day of highschool. Like when they just throw the freshman in to find
        their classes. Except I'm a salty, tired, very lame adult. "Let's go around the room and share a quote that
        inspires us!" I <i>know</i> it's just... team building or whatever. "I don't want to play the game" says the
        board piece. I guess I'm supposed to just start my own company and be my own boss right? Thanks for your time.

        <h1>a couple tweaks here and there</h1>
        <h5>IV·XXII·MMXXV - IV·XXIV·MMXXV</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Couple neat things got done I suppose. Finally got around to throwing together a homegrown guestbook. Seems a bit insane
        to me that there are so few applications out there. I constantly overestimate the number of personal site nerds.
        Neat to get it up though! I didn't want to run anything too crazy, just have some control over the css nawmean?
        Anyways, last animation went up in flames. Re-rendering 1k frames is always a blast. Got to learn a bit about
        the botnet render setup I was running, should be smoother sailing next time. I'm being bombarded by afterhour updates.
        Mostly people still trying to hype $rxrx. Personally just seems like a <i>bit</i> of a meme. What do I know though?
        I'm down 0.82% as of time of writing. That jesus and john wayne book is draining me. So boring and repetitive so far.
        It did help slightly guide a conversation with a good friend last night. Not a waste. Bunny day is finally done.
        I missed buying turnips this week though. I think I still have a stash of half a million bells, plenty of wiggle room.
        Final thoughts? I'm a bit hungry. I should eat breakfast earlier in the day. Pushing that off to send an update into the
        void is a bit silly. This isn't even devlog/update stuff. Pure morning stream of consciousness lmfao. Thanks for your time.

        <h5>IV·XX·MMXXV - IV·XXI·MMXXV</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Diary/devlog type page for y'all I guess? Just a way for me to keep thoughts a bit more seperated and focused.
        Want to leave room for pretentious rambling perhaps without making my full front-facing site too casual.
        Happy easter! I'm looking forward to bunny day being over. Everytime I'm in the mood for some nh that rabbit is <nobr>l u r k i n g</nobr>.
        I need to update my main site w a few more animations that finally finished. There's one more being rendered now.
        Probably best to wait a bit. I'm having a ton of fun learning blender and touchdesigner.
        Absolutely draining though to ask for every single view. At the end of the day, my "art" is far from polished OR unique, so I get it.
        I don't know maaan, it's less about the <nobr>views/recognition/path to monetization.</nobr> More that anyone who <i>might</i>
        fuck with it just isn't seeing it. Pray to the algorithms I suppose. I'm certainly not doing myself any favors with the
        atrocious seo that I have going on. What happened to doing it for the love of the game. I don't <i>want</i> to be a
        marketer. That type of thinking is pretty entitled though. Can't be asking for instant gratification with objectively uninteresting hobby work.
        /shrug gotta focus on the fun of it. The real ones get it. Looking forward to a nice week ahead. The sun's out in full force
        and my work calendar is clear enough. (I'm cutting it close w rambling here before a meeting) I figured out a smarter
        way to spit renders out so hopefully there's a site update soon. Thanks for your time.
